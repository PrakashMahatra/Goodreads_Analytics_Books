Why do most animals only get one billion beats? (And how did modern humans get to over two billion, effectively letting us live out two lives?) Why are sufferers of gingivitis more likely to have heart attacks? Why do we often undergo expensive procedures when cheaper ones are just as effective? What do Da Vinci, Mary Shelley, and contemporary Egyptian archaeologists have in common? And what does it really feel like to touch your own heart, or to have someone else's beating inside your chest? Rob Dunn's fascinating history of our hearts brings us deep inside the science, history, and stories of the four chambers we depend on most.","384 pages, Hardcover",Nonfiction,125 followers,101 reviews,17 books125 followers,5 (<1%),43 (5%),154 (21%),322 (44%),194 (27%)

Empress Dowager Cixi: The Concubine Who Launched Modern China,Jung Chang,"9,656","ratings1,093","First published September 26, 2013","A New York Times Notable BookEmpress Dowager Cixi (1835–1908) is the most important woman in Chinese history. She ruled China for decades and brought a medieval empire into the modern age.At the age of sixteen, in a nationwide selection for royal consorts, Cixi was chosen as one of the emperor’s numerous concubines. When he died in 1861, their five-year-old son succeeded to the throne. Cixi at once launched a palace coup against the regents appointed by her husband and made herself the real ruler of China—behind the throne, literally, with a silk screen separating her from her officials who were all male.In this groundbreaking biography, Jung Chang vividly describes how Cixi fought against monumental obstacles to change China. Under her the ancient country attained virtually all the attributes of a modern industries, railways, electricity, the telegraph and an army and navy with up-to-date weaponry. It was she who abolished gruesome punishments like “death by a thousand cuts” and put an end to foot-binding. She inaugurated women’s liberation and embarked on the path to introduce parliamentary elections to China. Chang comprehensively overturns the conventional view of Cixi as a diehard conservative and cruel despot.Cixi reigned during extraordinary times and had to deal with a host of major national the Taiping and Boxer rebellions, wars with France and Japan—and an invasion by eight allied powers including Britain, Germany, Russia and the United States. Jung Chang not only records the Empress Dowager’s conduct of domestic and foreign affairs, but also takes the reader into the depths of her splendid Summer Palace and the harem of Beijing’s Forbidden City, where she lived surrounded by eunuchs—one of whom she fell in love, with tragic consequences. The world Chang describes here, in fascinating detail, seems almost unbelievable in its extraordinary mixture of the very old and the very new.Based on newly available, mostly Chinese, historical documents such as court records, official and private correspondence, diaries and eyewitness accounts, this biography will revolutionize historical thinking about a crucial period in China’s—and the world’s—history. Packed with drama, fast paced and gripping, it is both a panoramic depiction of the birth of modern China and an intimate portrait of a as the concubine to a monarch, as the absolute ruler of a third of the world’s population, and as a unique stateswoman.","436 pages, Hardcover",History,"1,482 followers","1,093 reviews","12 books1,482 followers",309 (3%),556 (5%),"1,936 (20%)","3,939 (40%)","2,916 (30%)"

Season of the Witch is the first book to fully capture the dark magic of San Francisco in this breathtaking period, when the city radically changed itself & then revolutionized the world. The cool gray city of love was the epicenter of the 60s cultural revolution. But by the early 70s, San Francisco’s ecstatic experiment came crashing down from its starry heights. The city was rocked by savage murder sprees, mysterious terror campaigns, political assassinations, street riots & finally a terrifying sexual epidemic. No other city endured so many calamities in such a short time span. Talbot goes deep into the riveting story of his city’s ascent, decline & heroic recovery. He draws intimate portraits of San Francisco’s legendary demons & saviors: Charles Manson, Patty Hearst & the Symbionese Liberation Army, Jerry Garcia, Janis Joplin, Bill Graham, Herb Caen, the Cockettes, Harvey Milk, Jim Jones & the Peoples Temple, Joe Montana & the Super Bowl 49ers. He reveals how the city emerged from the trials of this period with a new brand of “San Francisco values,” including gay marriage, medical marijuana, immigration sanctuary, universal health care, recycling, renewable energy, consumer safety & a living wage mandate. Considered radical when they were first introduced, these ideas have become the bedrock of decent society in many parts of the country & exemplify the ways that the city now inspires a live-and-let-live tolerance, a shared sense of humanity & an openness to change. As a new generation of activists & dreamers seeks its own path to a more enlightened future, Season of the Witch—with its epic tale of the wild & bloody birth of San Francisco values—offers both inspiration & cautionary wisdom.","453 pages, Hardcover",History,229 followers,821 reviews,53 books229 followers,35 (<1%),127 (2%),747 (12%),"2,268 (37%)","2,859 (47%)"

During that time, the Church of the Hallowed Pact has assigned a new bishop to the city—but it has also made its displeasure at the death of its clergyman quite clear. Davillon’s economy has suffered beneath the weight of the Church’s displeasure. Much of the populace—angry at the clergy— has turned away from the Church hierarchy, choosing private worship or small, independent shrines. And the bishop, concerned for his new position and angry at the people of Davillon, plans to do something about it. But a supernatural threat is stalking the nighttime streets—a creature of the other world has come to infiltrate the seedier streets of Davillon, to intertwine its tendrils through the lower echelons of society. Faced with both political upheaval and a supernatural threat to its citizenry, the local representatives of the Church are paralyzed and the Guardsmen are in over their heads. And then there’s Widdershins--who’s tried, and failed, to stay out of trouble since taking over Genevieve’s tavern; who’s known to the Church and the Guard both, and trusted by neither; who may, with some of her Thieves’ Guild contacts, have unwittingly played a part in the bishop’s plans; and who, along with her personal god Olgun, may be the only real threat to the supernatural evil infesting Davillon.","281 pages, Hardcover",Fantasy,409 followers,140 reviews,103 books409 followers,10 (<1%),38 (2%),262 (19%),571 (42%),464 (34%)

In his newest novel Kellerman delivers a tour de force–poignant, dark, and chilling–that illuminates a shadowy world where impulse rules.Tanya Bigelow was a solemn little girl when Dr. Alex Delaware successfully treated her obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Now, at nineteen, she still seems older than her years–but her problems go beyond hyper-maturity. Patty Bigelow, Tanya’s aunt and adoptive mother, has made a deathbed confession of murder and urged the young woman to seek Delaware’s help.

Lott, Jr., answers these and other common economic questions, bravely confronting the profound distrust of the market that the bestselling book Freakonomics has helped to popularize. Using clear and hard-hitting examples, Lott shows how free markets liberate the best, most creative, and most generous aspects of our society--while efforts to constrain economic liberty, no matterhow well-intentioned, invariably lead to increased poverty and injustice. Extendingits rigorous economic analysis even further to our political and criminal justicesystems, Freedomnomics ? How the free market creates incentives for people to behave honestly? How political campaign restrictions keep incumbents in power? Why legalized abortion leads to family breakdown, which creates more crime? Why affirmative action in police departments leads to higher crime rates? How women's suffrage led to a massive increase in the size of government· Why women become more conservative when they get married and moreliberal when they get divorced? How secret ballots reduce voter participation? Why state-owned companies and government agencies are much more likely to engage in unfair predation than are private firms? Why the controversial assertions made in the trendy book Freakonomics are almost entirely wrongEntertaining, persuasive, and based on dozens of economic studies spanning decades, Freedomnomics not only shows how free markets really work--but proves that, when it comes to promoting prosperity and economic justice, nothing works better.","275 pages, Hardcover",Economics,48 followers,70 reviews,21 books48 followers,32 (5%),53 (9%),166 (29%),201 (35%),114 (20%)

In Jones’ Jersey, the extraordinary is ordinary for the people who live there and the Garden State is a place for all time that is about to change forever.","152 pages, Paperback",Short Stories,8 followers,3 reviews,33 books8 followers,2 (14%),2 (14%),1 (7%),3 (21%),6 (42%)

"By Fire, By Water",Mitchell James Kaplan,"1,146",ratings203,"First published May 18, 2010","Luis de Santángel, chancellor to the court and longtime friend of the lusty King Ferdinand, has had enough of the Spanish Inquisition. As the power of Inquisitor General Tomás de Torquemada grows, so does the brutality of the Spanish church and the suspicion and paranoia it inspires. When a dear friend’s demise brings the violence close to home, Santángel is enraged and takes retribution into his own hands. But he is from a family of conversos, and his Jewish heritage makes him an easy target. As Santángel witnesses the horrific persecution of his loved ones, he begins slowly to reconnect with the Jewish faith his family left behind. Feeding his curiosity about his past is his growing love for Judith Migdal, a clever and beautiful Jewish woman navigating the mounting tensions in Granada. While he struggles to decide what his reputation is worth and what he can sacrifice, one man offers him a chance he thought he’d lost…the chance to hope for a better world. Christopher Columbus has plans to discover a route to paradise, and only Luis de Santángel can help him.Within the dramatic story lies a subtle, insightful examination of the crisis of faith at the heart of the Spanish Inquisition. Irresolvable conflict rages within the conversos in By Fire, By Water, torn between the religion they left behind and the conversion meant to ensure their safety.

Ghosts of The Soon Departed,T.A. Epley,7,ratings3,"First published June 22, 2011","Insanity, imprisonment, and death haunt a dynasty of poor Appalachians, as four generations vainly spend their strength in the pursuit of a mysterious cache of Civil War blood-money. Ghosts of The Soon Departed tells the story of one family’s obsession. William is a Naval officer and strict Calvinist, preoccupied with the concept of destiny. Caleb is a Confederate veteran, traumatized by his internment as a prisoner of war. Marshall is a bricklayer, resourceful and loyal to his family; he is contemptuous of the fabled gold as it threatens to destroy those around him. Julia is a beautiful, coquettish, and spirited belle of the new south. Gene, a depression era moonshiner and schemer, is resentful of the pious affectations he’s confronted with. R.C. works in a cardboard packaging plant, seeks advancement, considers himself classless, and forgives no one. Through their struggles an epoch is illuminated. Along the way, we witness visions tantamount to a litany of the realm known as Dixie.","378 pages, Paperback",historical,1 follower,3 reviews,1 book1 follower,0 (0%),1 (14%),2 (28%),1 (14%),3 (42%)
Under the Mercy Trees,Heather Newton,775,ratings139,"First published December 29, 2010","Newton delivers a stirring debut novel told from the perspectives of four central characters embroiled in a family drama that spans generations and is riddled with defensive secrecy and emotional penury in equal measure. After the disappearance of Leon Owenby, his younger brother and central narrator, Martin, returns to the family’s Willoby County, N.C., mountain town from his life as a destitute writer in New York City to aid in the search for Leon and support his other siblings. The year is 1986; Martin leaves behind his ex-lover, Dennis, and their many friends sick and dying from AIDS. Back home, he must face his painful past, his extended family to whom he is closeted, and his high school girlfriend (who still carries a torch for him). Many months of searching reveal more about the searchers than about Leon; the secrets and resentments in the Owenby family run deep and bubble to the surface unexpectedly. It’s problematic that with so many family issues coming to light, Martin’s sexuality is ignored and remains a secret, but Newton’s use of multiple viewpoints and distinct voices is adept and lively, and helps to fill in the thin premise of Leon’s disappearance. With many novels of this construction, a reader tends to favor one voice over the rest. Not so here; Newton delivers across the board with these characters, who run the gamut from perky to depressive, desperate to schizophrenic.","352 pages, Paperback",Fiction,34 followers,139 reviews,8 books34 followers,26 (3%),55 (7%),299 (38%),266 (34%),129 (16%)
