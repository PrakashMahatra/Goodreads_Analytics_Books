"A Primate's Memoir : Love, Death and Baboons in East Africa",Robert M. Sapolsky,"7,863",ratings908,"January 1, 2001","'I had never planned to become a Savannah baboon when I grew up; instead I assumed I would become a mountain gorilla,' writes Robert Sapolsky in this riveting chronicle of a scientist's coming of age in remote Africa. Upon graduating from college, a booksmart and naive Sapolsky leaves the comforts of the Northeastern United States for the very first time, to join a baboon troop in Kenya as a young transfer male'. An expert in primate behaviour, Sapolsky sets out to study the relationship between stress and disease. As he observes the Machiavellian politics of the troop, giving the primates biblical names and pinpointing his favourite (Benjamin) and his nemesis (Nebuchadnezzar), he also immerses himself in the society of the neighbouring Masai tribesmen and ventures far from his camp on a series of jaw-dropping adventures. Combining irreverence and humour with the best credentials in his field, Sapolsky writes as originally and vividly about people and their society as he does about animals and theirs. ""A Primate's Memoir"" is the culmination of over two decades of experience and research - an astonishing masterpiece from the unique talent Oliver Sacks has called 'one of the best scientist-writers of our time.'","304 pages, Paperback",Science,"4,165 follower",908 reviews,23,78 (<1%),171 (2%),846 (10%),"2,404 (30%)","4,364 (55%)"
"Radiohead and Philosophy: Fitter, Happier, More Deductive (Popular Culture and Philosophy)",Brandon W. Forbes,239,ratings19,"April 1, 2009","Since their breakthrough hit ""Creep"" in 1993, Radiohead has continued to make waves throughout popular and political culture with its views about the Bush presidency (its 2003 album was titled Hail to the Thief ), its anti-corporatism, its pioneering efforts to produce ecologically sound road tours, and, most of all, its decision in 2007 to sell its latest album, In Rainbows, online with a controversial ""pay-what-you-want"" price. Radiohead and Philosophy offers fresh ways to appreciate the lyrics, music, and conceptual ground of this highly innovative band. The chapters in this book explain how Radiohead’s music connects directly to the philosophical phenomenology of thinkers like Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Martin Heidegger, the existentialism of Albert Camus and Jean Paul Sartre, and the philosophical politics of Karl Marx, Jean Baudrillard, and Noam Chomsky. Fans and critics know that Radiohead is ""the only band that matters"" on the scene today — Radiohead and Philosophy shows why.","288 pages, Paperback",Music,2 follower,19 reviews,5,7 (2%),21 (8%),59 (24%),93 (38%),59 (24%)

This has been a matter of bitter political debate, of course, but what is incontestable is that a sizable percentage of American soldiers sent overseas in this era have been women. The experience in the American military is, it's safe to say, quite different from that of men. Surrounded and far outnumbered by men, embedded in a male culture, looked upon as both alien and desirable, women have experiences of special interest.In Soldier Girls, Helen Thorpe follows the lives of three women over twelve years on their paths to the military, overseas to combat, and back home, and then overseas again for two of them. These women, who are quite different in every way, become friends, and we watch their interaction and also what happens when they are separated. We see their families, their lovers, their spouses, their children. We see them work extremely hard, deal with the attentions of men on base and in war zones, and struggle to stay connected to their families back home. We see some of them drink too much, have illicit affairs, and react to the deaths of fellow soldiers. And we see what happens to one of them when the truck she is driving hits an explosive in the road, blowing it up. She survives, but her life may never be the same again.Deeply reported, beautifully written, and powerfully moving, Soldier Girls is truly groundbreaking.","397 pages, Hardcover",Nonfiction,105 follower,427 reviews,6,44 (1%),149 (6%),546 (24%),937 (41%),595 (26%)
Franklin and Winston: An Intimate Portrait of an Epic Friendship,Jon Meacham,"7,942",ratings549,"October 14, 2003","Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill were the greatest leaders of ""the Greatest Generation."" In Franklin and Winston, Jon Meacham explores the fascinating relationship between the two men who piloted the free world to victory in World War II. It was a crucial friendship, and a unique one--a president and a prime minister spending enormous amounts of time together (113 days during the war) and exchanging nearly two thousand messages. Amid cocktails, cigarettes, and cigars, they met, often secretly, in places as far-flung as Washington, Hyde Park, Casablanca, and Teheran, talking to each other of war, politics, the burden of command, their health, their wives, and their children.Born in the nineteenth century and molders of the twentieth and twenty-first, Roosevelt and Churchill had much in common. Sons of the elite, students of history, politicians of the first rank, they savored power. In their own time both men were underestimated, dismissed as arrogant, and faced skeptics and haters in their own nations--yet both magnificently rose to the central challenges of the twentieth century. Theirs was a kind of love story, with an emotional Churchill courting an elusive Roosevelt. The British prime minister, who rallied his nation in its darkest hour, standing alone against Adolf Hitler, was always somewhat insecure about his place in FDR's affections--which was the way Roosevelt wanted it. A man of secrets, FDR liked to keep people off balance, including his wife, Eleanor, his White House aides--and Winston Churchill.Confronting tyranny and terror, Roosevelt and Churchill built a victorious alliance amid cataclysmic events and occasionally conflicting interests. Franklin and Winston is also the story of their marriages and their families, two clans caught up in the most sweeping global conflict in history.Meacham's new sources--including unpublished letters of FDR's great secret love, Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd, the papers of Pamela Churchill Harriman, and interviews with the few surviving people who were in FDR and Churchill's joint company--shed fresh light on the characters of both men as he engagingly chronicles the hours in which they decided the course of the struggle.Hitler brought them together; later in the war, they drifted apart, but even in the autumn of their alliance, the pull of affection was always there. Charting the personal drama behind the discussions of strategy and statecraft, Meacham has written the definitive account of the most remarkable friendship of the modern age.","490 pages, Paperback",History,"2,714 follower",549 reviews,64,100 (1%),227 (2%),"1,236 (15%)","3,229 (40%)","3,150 (39%)"

Uśmiech Pol Pota. o pewnej szwedzkiej podróży przez Kambodżę Czerwonych Khmerów,Peter Fröberg Idling,941,ratings60,"January 1, 2006","W 1975 roku, po pięciu latach bezmyślnych rządów wojskowej kliki generała Lon Nola, władzę w Kambodży zdobywają Czerwoni Khmerzy. Mają ogromne poparcie ludu i lewicujących środowisk europejskich. Zniszczony amerykańskimi nalotami i wojną domową kraj przedzierzga się w Demokratyczną Kampuczę, w której hasła chłopskiej rewolucji mają zbudować nową, lepszą przyszłość. Peter Fröberg Idling zabiera czytelników w przerażającą i fascynującą podróż do serca tego kraju. Niczym detektyw śledzi sprzeczne doniesienia, ze strzępów informacji buduje prawdziwy obraz życia w obłąkańczej utopii i odsłania tajemnice jednej z najkrwawszych dyktatur XX wieku.Odkrywa też niechlubną kartę z przeszłości. Szwedzcy entuzjaści rewolucji Pol Pota, głusi na relacje uchodźców, niezachwianie wierzyli, że czerwony terror to tylko konieczny etap na słusznej drodze do wyzwolenia. Fröberg Idling pyta, w jaki sposób udało się Khmerom zamydlić oczy szwedzkiej delegacji, która w 1978 roku odwiedziła Kampuczę. Dlaczego w sprawozdaniach, na zdjęciach i w filmie nie widać zagłodzonych i zastraszonych ludzi, o których mówili uciekinierzy?Pragnie również zrozumieć, co sprawiło, że Saloth Sar, wykształcony w Paryżu młody fan piłki nożnej i francuskiej poezji romantycznej, stał się Pol Potem, krwawym tyranem, pod którego rządami zginęła prawie jedna czwarta ludności całego kraju. Odpowiedzi szuka zarówno w dokumentach, jak i w rozmowach ze świadkami terroru Czerwonych Khmerów. Z relacji tych buduje literacki reportaż przejmujący do szpiku kości.""To prawdopodobnie jedna z najlepszych dokumentalnych książek tego roku. (…) Materiałów na temat Kambodży i rządów Pol Pota opublikowano wiele, ale Peter Fröberg Idling przedstawia tę dramatyczną historię w całkiem nowy sposób. I choć temat jest przerażający, to naszkicowany przez Idlinga portret kraju i ludzi jest przede wszystkim poetycki. Kojarzy się ze stylem Svena Lindqvista, szwedzkiego mistrza podróżniczego reportażu, lub jego duńskiego odpowiednika, Carstena Jensena. (…) A ponieważ świat jest zły, zróbmy dobry uczynek: pomóżmy tej książce wypchnąć z listy bestsellerów wszystkich bohaterów wojennych, uzdrowicieli i nawiedzonych dietetyków"".""Dagbladet""""To powieść dokumentalna najwyższej klasy, sięgająca po najlepsze techniki literackie. Otrzymujemy świeże, wnikliwe spojrzenie połączone z zapierającym dech w piersiach doświadczeniem czytelniczym"".""Potemkinreisen""""Uśmiech Pol Pota to subtelna i mimo swej tematyki niemal piękna książka, stawiająca niezwykle ważne pytanie: Jak chronić się przed politycznymi marzycielami i fanatykami, tak by nie zniszczyć jednocześnie możliwości stworzenia lepszego świata? Żyjemy w czasach, w których nie wszystkim idealistom udaje się odróżnić totalitaryzm od ruchów demokratycznych. Uśmiech Pol Pota to książka, która zwraca się do jednych i do drugich"".""Dagens Næringsliv""""Idling stworzył przenikliwą i dramatyczną opowieść o tym, jak zagłodzono i wymordowano 1,7 miliona ludzi, nie pokazując międzynarodowej opinii publicznej nawet jednego ciała. Długo i uważnie przyglądał się uśmiechowi Pol Pota, który – gdy się mu przypatrzeć – okazuje się grymasem drwiny"".""Bergensavisen""""Uśmiech Pol Pota to nie tylko świetny reportaż, ale także bardzo dobra powieść.

Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present,Harriet A. Washington,"8,421",ratings951,"January 9, 2007","From the era of slavery to the present day, the first full history of black America’s shocking mistreatment as unwilling and unwitting experimental subjects at the hands of the medical establishment.

Medical Apartheid is the first and only comprehensive history of medical experimentation on African Americans. Starting with the earliest encounters between black Americans and Western medical researchers and the racist pseudoscience that resulted, it details the ways both slaves and freedmen were used in hospitals for experiments conducted without their knowledge—a tradition that continues today within some black populations. It reveals how blacks have historically been prey to grave-robbing as well as unauthorized autopsies and dissections. Moving into the twentieth century, it shows how the pseudoscience of eugenics and social Darwinism was used to justify experimental exploitation and shoddy medical treatment of blacks, and the view that they were biologically inferior, oversexed, and unfit for adult responsibilities. Shocking new details about the government’s notorious Tuskegee experiment are revealed, as are similar, less-well-known medical atrocities conducted by the government, the armed forces, prisons, and private institutions.The product of years of prodigious research into medical journals and experimental reports long undisturbed, Medical Apartheid reveals the hidden underbelly of scientific research and makes possible, for the first time, an understanding of the roots of the African American health deficit. At last, it provides the fullest possible context for comprehending the behavioral fallout that has caused black Americans to view researchers—and indeed the whole medical establishment—with such deep distrust. No one concerned with issues of public health and racial justice can afford not to read Medical Apartheid, a masterful book that will stir up both controversy and long-needed debate.","501 pages, Hardcover",Nonfiction,407 follower,951 reviews,7,52 (<1%),166 (1%),753 (8%),"2,674 (31%)","4,776 (56%)"

Life on Air: Memoirs of a Broadcaster,David Attenborough,"4,160",ratings401,"384 pages, PaperbackPublished January 1, 2003","David Attenborough hardly needs any introduction; his voice has accompanied so many of the best natural history programs that have graced our televisions over several decades. Life On Air , his autobiography, tells the story of how he has managed to professionalise his schoolboy interests in such a remarkably successful way. Attenborough's Life On Air began in 1950, having taken a degree in Natural Sciences in the University of Cambridge, done National Service in the Navy, got married, done a year as an editor with an educational publisher, had a son and then answered a BBC recruiting ad in the Times . Turned down for BBC Radio, he was offered a traineeship in BBC TV which was pioneering the medium in Britain and he has never looked back. The rest is TV history and you can read Sir David's personal view of it all in his engaging and highly entertaining book. This is no boring story of the rise and rise of a media mogul in the smoke-filled rooms of Ally Pally and Lime Grove. Having served his apprenticeship producing programmes like Animal, Vegetable, Mineral? and Song Hunter with the famous American folk singer and song collector Alan Lomax, he managed to escape from the confines of overlit studios into the natural world. Zoo Quest began in 1954 with an animal collecting trip to Sierra Leone and David Attenborough had found his metier. Since then he has managed to bring the wonders of the natural world into millions of living rooms around the world and to reach general audiences without patronising them, without any spurious antics, silly voices or dumbing down. His animal and plant subjects are the stars, Attenborough is the master of ceremonies who introduces the acts for our wonder and amazement. But his scope extends way beyond the birds and the bees. In the 1960s, it was suggested that he took up an administrative post--""after all, you won't want to be gallivanting around the world when you are 50"". Fortunately, he did not abandon gallivanting for admin but went freelance, studied anthropology and helped extend our view of native peoples and sympathies for their life styles. He went on to become responsible for coming up with famous BBC TV series such as Kenneth Clark's incredibly successful Civilisation series, followed by Bronowski's The Ascent of Man . Inevitably, he did become one of the BBC suits but one that wore a camouflage jacket. What is remarkable is that Attenborough has managed to do it for so long without really changing his own style too much. He has not had to because the technology has changed and so he has constantly been able to give new views and insights into the details of life on Earth. Writing pretty much as he speaks, it is easy to hear his voice, dry sense of humour and generosity coming through all the time. Do not expect to read personal details, navel-gazing or malicious gossip--that is not his style. The only personal note comes at the end with the death of his wife in 1997. Over 100 photos associated with the huge range of programmes he has been intimately involved with decorate Life On Air , a fascinating personal story of our times. He says that he knows of ""no pleasure deeper than that which comes from contemplating the natural world and trying to understand it""; he certainly manages to convey that in Life On Air . -- Douglas Palmer","384 pages, Paperback",Nonfiction,"2,314 follower",401 reviews,148,31 (<1%),61 (1%),380 (9%),"1,380 (33%)","2,308 (55%)"

In “What It Was Like, Part One,” Graham sits down for an epic Gilmore Girls marathon and reflects on being cast as the fast-talking Lorelai Gilmore. The essay “What It Was Like, Part Two” reveals how it felt to pick up the role again nine years later, and what doing so has meant to her.

With China on the rise, so, too, are the American cities of the West coast, including Seattle, San Francisco, and the long cluster of towns down the Silicon Valley.Today, the Pacific is ascendant. Its geological history has long transformed us—tremendous earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis—but its human history, from a Western perspective, is quite young, beginning with Magellan’s sixteenth-century circumnavigation.

His journey encompasses a trip down the Alaska Highway, a stop at the isolated Pitcairn Islands, a trek across South Korea and a glimpse of its mysterious northern neighbor.Winchester’s personal experience is vast and his storytelling second to none.

Walton, author of the bestselling Lost World of Genesis One, and D. Brent Sandy, author of Plowshares and Pruning Hooks, comes a detailed look at the origins of scriptural authority in ancient oral cultures and how they inform our understanding of the Old and New Testaments today. Stemming from questions about scriptural inerrancy, inspiration and oral transmission of ideas, The Lost World of Scripture examines the process by which the Bible has come to be what it is today. From the reasons why specific words were used to convey certain ideas to how oral tradition impacted the transmission of biblical texts, the authors seek to uncover how these issues might affect our current doctrine on the authority of Scripture. ""In this book we are exploring ways God chose to reveal his word in light of discoveries about ancient literary culture,"" write Walton and Sandy.

It is not just a work of history – but one of enthusiasm and unparalleled knowledge.' BERNARD CORNWELLRedcoat is the story of the British soldier from c.1760 until c.1860 – surely one of the most enduring and magnetic subjects of the British past. Solidly based on the letters and diaries of the men who served and the women who followed them, the book is rich in the history of the period. It charts Wolfe's victory and death at Quebec, the American War of Independence, the Duke of York's campaign in Flanders, Wellington's Peninsular War, Waterloo,the retreat from Kabul, the Sikh wars in 1845-9, the Crimean war and the Indian Mutiny.The focus of Redcoat, however, is the individual recollection and experience of the ordinary soldiers serving in the wars fought by Georgian and early Victorian England.Through their stories and anecdotes – of uniforms, equipment,'taking the King's shilling', flogging, wounds, food, barrack life, courage, comradeship, death, love and loss – Richard Holmes provides a comprehensive portrait of a fallible but extraordinarily successful fighting force.'Such a scene of mortal strife from the fire of fifty men was never witnessed…' writes Harry Smith of the 95th Rifles, recounting the death of a brother officer in Spain in 1813. 'I wept over his remains with a bursting heart as, with his company who adored him, I consigned to the grave the last external appearance of Daniel Cadoux. His fame can never die.' Smith's account is typical of the emotions and experiences of the men who appear on every page of this book, sporting their red uniforms to fight for King and country.","466 pages, Paperback",History,83 follower,53 reviews,117,7 (<1%),27 (3%),111 (15%),309 (43%),257 (36%)

From A to X: A Story in Letters,John Berger,"1,527",ratings169,"January 1, 2008","In the dusty, ramshackle town of Suse lives A’ida. Her insurgent lover Xavier has been imprisoned. Resolute, sensuous and tender, A’ida’s letters to the man she loves tell of daily events in the town, and of its motley collection of inhabitants whose lives flow through hers. But the area is under threat, and as a faceless power inexorably encroaches from outside, so the smallest details and acts of humanity—an intimate dance, a shared meal—assume for A’ida a life-affirming significance, acts of resistance against the forces that might otherwise extinguish them. From A to X is a powerful exploration of how humanity affirms itself in struggle: imagining a community which, besieged by economic and military imperialism, finds transcendent hope in the pain and fragility, vulnerability and sorrow of daily existence.","197 pages, Hardcover",Fiction,"2,104 follower",169 reviews,273,70 (4%),107 (7%),325 (21%),473 (30%),552 (36%)
Escape,Carolyn Jessop,"44,166","ratings4,963","October 16, 2007","The dramatic first-person account of life inside an ultra-fundamentalist American religious sect, and one woman’s courageous flight to freedom with her eight children.When she was eighteen years old, Carolyn Jessop was coerced into an arranged marriage with a total stranger: a man thirty-two years her senior. Merril Jessop already had three wives. But arranged plural marriages were an integral part of Carolyn’s heritage: She was born into and raised in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), the radical offshoot of the Mormon Church that had settled in small communities along the Arizona-Utah border. Over the next fifteen years, Carolyn had eight children and withstood her husband’s psychological abuse and the watchful eyes of his other wives who were locked in a constant battle for supremacy.Carolyn’s every move was dictated by her husband’s whims. He decided where she lived and how her children would be treated. He controlled the money she earned as a school teacher. He chose when they had sex; Carolyn could only refuse—at her peril. For in the FLDS, a wife’s compliance with her husband determined how much status both she and her children held in the family. Carolyn was miserable for years and wanted out, but she knew that if she tried to leave and got caught, her children would be taken away from her. No woman in the country had ever escaped from the FLDS and managed to get her children out, too. But in 2003, Carolyn chose freedom over fear and fled her home with her eight children. She had $20 to her name.Escape exposes a world tantamount to a prison camp, created by religious fanatics who, in the name of God, deprive their followers the right to make choices, force women to be totally subservient to men, and brainwash children in church-run schools. Against this background, Carolyn Jessop’s flight takes on an extraordinary, inspiring power. Not only did she manage a daring escape from a brutal environment, she became the first woman ever granted full custody of her children in a contested suit involving the FLDS. And in 2006, her reports to the Utah attorney general on church abuses formed a crucial part of the case that led to the arrest of their notorious leader, Warren Jeffs.","413 pages, Hardcover",Nonfiction,246 follower,"4,963 reviews",4,894 (2%),"1,989 (4%)","9,270 (20%)","17,306 (39%)","14,707 (33%)"
