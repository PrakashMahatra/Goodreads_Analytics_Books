The End of Loneliness,Benedict Wells,"37,225","ratings3,250","First published February 24, 2016","Jules Moreau’s childhood is shattered after the sudden death of his parents. Enrolled in boarding school where he and his siblings, Marty and Liz, are forced to live apart, the once vivacious and fearless Jules retreats inward, preferring to live within his memories--until he meets Alva, a kindred soul caught in her own grief. Fifteen years pass and the siblings remain strangers to one another, bound by tragedy and struggling to recover the family they once were. Jules, still adrift, is anchored only by his desires to be a writer and to reunite with Alva, who turned her back on their friendship on the precipice of it becoming more, but just as it seems they can make amends for time wasted, invisible forces--whether fate or chance--intervene. A kaleidoscopic family saga told through the fractured lives of the three Moreau siblings alongside a faltering, recovering love story, The End of Loneliness is a stunning meditation on the power of our memories, of what can be lost and what can never be let go. With inimitable compassion and luminous, affecting prose, Benedict Wells contends with what it means to find a way through life, while never giving up hope you will find someone to go with you.","274 pages, Kindle Edition",Fiction,"2,350 followers","3,250 reviews","13 books2,350 followers",218 (<1%),912 (2%),"4,125 (11%)","11,701 (31%)","20,269 (54%)"

Island Queen,Vanessa Riley,"3,902",ratings759,"First published July 6, 2021","A remarkable, sweeping historical novel based on the incredible true life story of Dorothy Kirwan Thomas, a free woman of color who rose from slavery to become one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners in the colonial West Indies. Born into slavery on the tiny Caribbean island of Montserrat, Doll bought her freedom—and that of her sister and her mother—from her Irish planter father and built a legacy of wealth and power as an entrepreneur, merchant, hotelier, and planter that extended from the marketplaces and sugar plantations of Dominica and Barbados to a glittering luxury hotel in Demerara on the South American continent.Vanessa Riley’s novel brings Doll to vivid life as she rises above the harsh realities of slavery and colonialism by working the system and leveraging the competing attentions of the men in her life: a restless shipping merchant, Joseph Thomas; a wealthy planter hiding a secret, John Coseveldt Cells; and a roguish naval captain who will later become King William IV of England.From the bustling port cities of the West Indies to the forbidding drawing rooms of London’s elite, Island Queen is a sweeping epic of an adventurer and a survivor who answered to no one but herself as she rose to power and autonomy against all odds, defying rigid eighteenth-century morality and the oppression of women as well as people of color. It is an unforgettable portrait of a true larger-than-life woman who made her mark on history.","592 pages, Hardcover",Historical Fiction,"1,463 followers",759 reviews,"40 books1,463 followers",72 (1%),213 (5%),898 (23%),"1,540 (39%)","1,179 (30%)"

With the People from the Bridge,Dimitris Lyacos,77,ratings8,"First published October 19, 2014","Acclaimed by critics worldwide, With the People from the Bridge is a unique distillation of literary genres, an all-in-one densely layered poem, play, postmodern epic, a small-scale wide-scope apocalyptic tragedy. An immersive experience where voices issue from characters in a state of trance, drift crackling out of a TV set or a cassette player and the contours of reality begin to darkle and shift while trains still pass up overhead, audience members get up to leave, performers creep out through back-exits. This is the day and the place for the imminent return of the dead and the reader sees them approaching as he peeks through the gaps of Lyacos's elliptical storytelling.  Radical in its recasting of content and narrative form this is one of those rare books that unravel visions of wholeness and collective redemption within the darkest aspects of our folk and religious tradition. Perhaps the dead can rise again. Perhaps the world is ending only to begin afresh.","46 pages, Kindle Edition",Poetry,78 followers,8 reviews,6 books78 followers,0 (0%),4 (5%),6 (7%),11 (14%),56 (72%)

Invisible Driving,Alistair McHarg,25,ratings1,"First published January 11, 2007","Invisible Driving is a memoir of Manic Depression that takes readers inside the terrors, thrills, and triumphs of coming to terms with this debilitating and misunderstood mental illness. The manic narrator's voice vividly recreates the feelings and sensations of mania, offering an unprecedented look at this fascinating and bizarre state of being. While behavior and thought illuminate the condition of mania, it is the protagonist's language itself that most viscerally conveys what it feels like to be trapped inside a manic 'high.' The voice of the recovered narrator provides context, reliability, and credibility. Where the manic narrator is relentlessly entertaining and delusional, the recovered narrator is tough minded, concise, and determined to reveal the truth, no matter how painful. With a cold eye he examines the forces that shaped him in order to shed light on the psychological architecture driving the episode. The interplay between these two perspectives underscores the bipolar nature of Manic Depression; the greatest personal challenge is reconciling them. Ultimately, the narrator must confront his own worst nightmare and in doing so gain character, insight, and acceptance.",Paperback,Memoir,3 followers,1 review,7 books3 followers,0 (0%),2 (8%),2 (8%),7 (28%),14 (56%)

Healing Through the Shadow of Loss,Deborah Morris Coryell,4,ratings1,"First published April 21, 2004","A guide to achieving wholeness through the process and purpose of grief• Brings new understanding to the profound mystery of loss shared by all human beings• Offers sensitive and practical advice for experiencing grief and how to prepare for the healing journey that follows• Winner of the Independent Publisher Award in 1999• New edition of Good Grief , published Oct 1995We grieve only for that which we have loved, and the transient nature of life makes love and loss intimate companions. In Healing Through the Shadow of Loss Deborah Morris Coryell describes grief as the experience of not having anywhere to place our love, of losing a connection, an outlet for our emotion. To heal grief we have to learn how to continue to love in the face of loss. Embracing loss allows us to awaken our most profound connections to other people.Part of the grieving process is finding our place in the world again following a loss. We tend to define ourselves in relation to those we love--as “Laura’s mother,” “Jim’s wife,” or “Stacey’s friend.” The loss of a loved one is jarring to these foundations and can make us question our own sense of reality. In addition, the body must adjust to the sensory changes of having lost a part of our life, a part of our daily existence. Coryell draws attention to our society’s tendency to rank losses in a “hierarchy of grief.” She reminds us that all losses must be grieved in their own right and on their own terms, and that we must honor the “big” losses as well as the “small” ones. Paying attention to even the most minute experiences of loss can help us to be more in tune with our responses to the greater ones, allowing us to once again become part of the rhythm of life from which we have become disconnected.","160 pages, Paperback",business-pers-growth,1 follower,1 review,5 books1 follower,1 (25%),0 (0%),1 (25%),1 (25%),1 (25%)

If there were speed limits for the sheer pulse-racing excitement allowed in one novel, ""Velocity"" would break them all. Get ready for the ride of your life. Bill Wiles is an easygoing, hardworking guy who leads a quiet, ordinary life. But that is about to change. One evening, after his usual eight-hour bartending shift, he finds a typewritten note under the windshield wiper of his car. 
""If you don't take this note to the police and get them involved, I will kill a lovely blond schoolteacher. If you do take this note to the police, I will instead kill an elderly woman active in charity work. You have four hours to decide. The choice is yours.""
It seems like a sick joke, and Bill's friend on the police force, Lanny Olson, thinks so too. His advice to Bill is to go home and forget about it. Besides, what could they do even if they took the note seriously? No crime has actually been committed. But less than twenty-four hours later, a young blond schoolteacher is found murdered, and it's Bill's fault: he didn't convince the police to get involved. Now he's got another note, another deadline, another ultimatum...and two new lives hanging in the balance. Suddenly Bill's average, seemingly innocuous life takes on the dimensions and speed of an accelerating nightmare. Because the notes are coming faster, the deadlines growing tighter, and the killer becoming bolder and crueler with every communication--until Bill is isolated with the terrifying knowledge that he alone has the power of life and death over a psychopath's innocent victims. Until the struggle between good and evil is intensely personal.
