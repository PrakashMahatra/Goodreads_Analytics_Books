"The Biology of Wonder: Aliveness, Feeling and the Metamorphosis of Science",Andreas Weber,84,ratings8,"February 25, 2016","The disconnection between humans and nature is perhaps one of the most fundamental problems faced by our species today. The schism between us and the natural world is arguably the root cause of most of the environmental catastrophes unraveling around us. However, until we come to terms with the depths of our alienation, we will continue to fail to understand that what happens to nature also happens to us. In The Biology of Wonder author Andreas Weber proposes a new approach to the biological sciences that puts the human back in nature. He argues that feelings and emotions, far from being superfluous to the study of organisms, are the very foundation of life. From this basic premise flows the development of a ""poetic ecology"" which intimately connects our species to everything that surrounds us—showing that subjectivity and imagination are prerequisites of biological existence. The Biology of Wonder demonstrates that there is no separation between us and the world we inhabit, and in so doing it validates the essence of our deep experience. By reconciling science with meaning, expression and emotion, this landmark work brings us to a crucial understanding of our place in the rich and diverse framework of life—a revolution for biology as groundbreaking as the theory of relativity for physics. Dr. Andreas Weber is a German academic, scholar and author. He is a leader in the emerging fields of ""biopoetics"" and ""biosemiotics,"" and his work has been translated into several languages and published around the globe.","387 pages, ebook",Science,32 follower,8 reviews,115,3 (3%),4 (4%),14 (16%),28 (33%),35 (41%)
Acquiring Genomes: A Theory Of The Origin Of Species,Lynn Margulis,272,ratings35,"January 1, 2002","In this groundbreaking book, Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan present an answer to one of the enduring mysteries of evolution -- the source of inherited variation that gives rise to new species. Random genetic mutation, long believed to be the main source of variation, is only a marginal factor. As the authors demonstrate in this book, the more important source of speciation, by far, is the acquisition of new genomes by symbiotic merger. The result of thirty years of delving into a vast, mostly arcane literature, this is the first book to go beyond -- and reveal the severe limitations of -- the ""Modern Synthesis"" that has dominated evolutionary biology for almost three generations. Lynn Margulis, whom E. O. Wilson called ""one of the most successful synthetic thinkers in modern biology,"" and her co-author Dorion Sagan have written a comprehensive and scientifically supported presentation of a theory that directly challenges the assumptions we hold about the variety of the living world.","256 pages, Paperback",Science,177 follower,35 reviews,89,1 (<1%),19 (6%),58 (21%),103 (37%),91 (33%)

These three women and their families, their losses and loves, unspool beautifully against a backdrop of a rapidly changing Oman, a country evolving from a traditional, slave-owning society into its complex present.

Shadow of the Silk Road,Colin Thubron,"4,140",ratings444,"January 1, 2007","Shadow of the Silk Road records a journey along the greatest land route on earth. Out of the heart of China into the mountains of Central Asia, across northern Afghanistan and the plains of Iran and into Kurdish Turkey, Colin Thubron covers some seven thousand miles in eight months. Making his way by local bus, truck, car, donkey cart and camel, he travels from the tomb of the Yellow Emperor, the mythic progenitor of the Chinese people, to the ancient port of Antioch—in perhaps the most difficult and ambitious journey he has undertaken in forty years of travel. The Silk Road is a huge network of arteries splitting and converging across the breadth of Asia. To travel it is to trace the passage not only of trade and armies but also of ideas, religions and inventions. But alongside this rich and astonishing past, Shadow of the Silk Road is also about Asia a continent of upheaval. One of the trademarks of Colin Thubron's travel writing is the beauty of his prose; another is his gift for talking to people and getting them to talk to him. Shadow of the Silk Road encounters Islamic countries in many forms. It is about changes in China, transformed since the Cultural Revolution. It is about false nationalisms and the world's discontented margins, where the true boundaries are not political borders but the frontiers of tribe, ethnicity, language and religion. It is a magnificent and important account of an ancient world in modern ferment.","384 pages, Hardcover",Travel,399 follower,444 reviews,63,93 (2%),295 (7%),"1,076 (25%)","1,622 (39%)","1,054 (25%)"
Bournemouth Boys and Boscombe Girls,Danny Winter,23,ratings0,"December 17, 2017","We’re the oddballs, weirdoes, comedians, eccentrics, head cases and hard cases, and this book is for those who ‘get it’ In the lead-up to a recent reunion party, many of the old stories came out. We were seasonal workers during the late ‘70s and early ‘80s in Bournemouth. Many worked the deckchairs, some worked hotels, pubs, bars, or nightclubs, either as bar staff or bouncers. We lived off our wits and, yes, from time to time we were rogues, but we had each other’s backs and we had some laughs. This book recalls those days and tells the story of bringing a special group of people back together again after almost 40 years. And do you know what, it was as if we hadn’t skipped a beat. There were even people who’d missed each other first time around, yet all of us have a very rare and exceptional connection. It’s pure magic. Now if you’re reading the above and are thinking this was some kind of school reunion with a bunch of old codgers on Zimmer fames, playing inflatable ball games and drinking Dandelion & Burdock, mate, you’ve got it all wrong! If you’ve worked holiday towns as a seasonal worker, either in the UK or abroad, then you’ll ‘get it’ or if you’re looking to work a season in Spain or Portugal or the South coast of England, then these are the tough but crazy times you can expect. I’ve always loved wild people and wild places, always been drawn to them, and here are some of the stories. Now, for the first time ever, I think I understand what was so special about those years. Yes, at times they were tough, but we stuck with each other through thick and thin, and especially afterwards when we travelled the globe together. We’re not crazy, none of us (well, those in prison and mental asylums might be), but none of us on the ‘out’ are, but we had lively, buoyant and animated fun. We were carefree at an age when you’re supposed to be carefree. The flip side of this, I’m well aware, is that at times it may make some of us feel as if we’re outsiders, a lone wolf so to speak. People occasionally talk about us in hushed tones, whispering that we’re a bit of a loose cannon. They don’t really want to say it to our faces because every now and again we can still be a little unpredictable. But they look at us with a strange curiosity, because in comparison – although they’re often very successful at ‘fitting in’ – they lead lives that are drab, dreary and monotonous. They’re not unruly like you and me. And it’s that unruliness which has kept us young. These are the stories, some told in very funny poetic format, of those years. This book has been published for the people who shared those years to be able to keep a record. If you weren’t around on the south coast during the late 70’s and early 80’s I’d honestly give this book a miss. That’s as honest as we can get, because you won’t know the people involved, and it’s unlikely you’ll ‘get it’ Some of us, you see, weren’t meant to be tamed. We weren’t meant to be pacified or subdued. We were meant to run free until we discovered others just as wild to run with. And after all we’ve been through, we’re still standing and we’re still laughing out loud. And that bothers some people. Danny and I wish to dedicate this book to all who couldn’t be there on the night. Some are living abroad, some are in prison, others in mental institutions, and some have passed on. This isn’t anything morbid. We just want to remember the laughs they gave us. KW","166 pages, Kindle Edition",Fiction,5 follower,0 reviews,3,1 (4%),2 (8%),3 (13%),3 (13%),14 (60%)

In the process, King refashions old stories about historical events and figures, takes a sideways look at film and pop culture, relates his own complex experiences with activism, and articulates a deep and revolutionary understanding of the cumulative effects of ever-shifting laws and treaties on Native peoples and lands.This is a book both timeless and timely, burnished with anger but tempered by wit, and ultimately a hard-won offering of hope—a sometimes inconvenient, but nonetheless indispensable account for all of us, Indian and non-Indian alike, seeking to understand how we might tell a new story for the future.","288 pages, Hardcover",Nonfiction,"1,181 follower","1,889 reviews",149,131 (<1%),386 (2%),"1,945 (12%)","6,540 (40%)","7,047 (43%)"

Hotel World,Ali Smith,"7,077",ratings763,"April 25, 2001","Five disparate voices inhabit Ali Smith's dreamlike, mesmerising Hotel World, set in the luxurious anonymity of the Global Hotel, in an unnamed northern English city. The disembodied yet interconnected characters include Sara, a 19-year-old chambermaid who has recently died at the hotel; her bereaved sister, Clare, who visits the scene of Sara's death; Penny, an advertising copywriter who is staying in the room opposite; Lise, the Global's depressed receptionist; and the homeless Else who begs on the street outside. Smith's ambitious prose explores all facets of language and its uses. Sara takes us through the moment of her exit from the world and beyond; in her desperate, fading grip on words and senses she gropes to impart the meaning of her death in what she terms ""the lift for dishes""--then comes a flash of clarity: ""That's the name for it, the name for it; that's it; dumb waiter dumb waiter dumb waiter."" Blended with hers are other voices: Penny's bland journalese and Else's obsession with metaphysical poetry.  Hotel World is not an easy read: disturbing and witty by turns, with its stream-of-consciousness narrators reminiscent of Virgina Woolf's The Waves, its deceptively rambling language is underpinned by a formal construction. Exploring the ""big themes"" of love, death and millennial capitalism, it takes as its starting point Muriel Spark's Momento Mori (""Remember you must die"") and counteracts this axiom with a resolute ""Remember you must live"". Ali Smith's novel is a daring, compelling, and frankly spooky read. --Catherine Taylor","238 pages, Paperback",Fiction,"4,593 follower",763 reviews,148,267 (3%),771 (10%),"2,063 (29%)","2,506 (35%)","1,470 (20%)"

Club , a painfully funny memoir as seen through the sturdy prism of pop culture—for fans of Chuck Klosterman and Augusten Burroughs. As a child and teenager, Nathan Rabin viewed pop culture as a life-affirming form of escape. As an adult, pop culture became his life. For more than a decade he’s served as head writer for The Onion A.V. Club , and here, by way of music, books, films, and television, he shares his too-strange-for-fiction life story. Using a specific book, song, album, film, or television show as a springboard to discuss a period in his life, Rabin recounts his Dickensian upbringing with biting wit and brutal, perhaps unwise candor. Throughout a traumatic childhood that sent him ricocheting from a mental hospital to a foster home to a group home for emotionally disturbed adolescents, Rabin reveals that not only did pop culture shape and mold him, it helped save him from suicidal depression, institu- tionalization, and parental abandonment. Perhaps the most entertaining book ever written about depression and sweet, sweet sexual humiliation, The Big Rewind is also an emotional tale of a motherless child’s search for family and acceptance and a darkly comic valentine to Rabin’s irascible, lovable, hard-luck dad. Featuring unexpected cameos by Billy Bob Thornton, a vomiting Topher Grace, and some dude named Barack Obama, The Big Rewind chronicles the surreal journey of Rabin’s life, and its intersection with the dizzying, maddening, wonderful world of entertainment.","368 pages, Hardcover",Memoir,185 follower,114 reviews,21,32 (3%),122 (15%),284 (35%),272 (33%),95 (11%)

They’re reminded of the town’s less desirable outskirts—with their grim, flimsy housing stock and chain stores—only when their neighbors have the presumption to claim also to live in Hanmouth. When an eight-year-old girl from the outer area goes missing, England’s eyes suddenly turn toward the sleepy town with a curiosity as piercing and unblinking as the closed-circuit security cameras that line Hanmouth’s idyllic streets. But somehow these cameras have missed the abduction of the girl, whose name is China. Is her blank-eyed hairdresser mother hiding her as part of a moneymaking hoax? Has she been abducted by one of the lurking perverts the townspeople imagine the cameras are protecting them from? Perhaps more cameras are needed?

What he got was a virtual cattle prod to the crotch, in the form of an impossible assignment delivered directly from the president's heroin-addict chief of staff. It seems the Constitution of the United States has some skeletons in its closet: the Founding Fathers doubted that the document would be able to stave off human nature indefinitely, so they devised a backup Constitution to deploy at the first sign of crisis. In the government's eyes, that time is now, as America is overgrown with perverts who spend more time surfing the Web for fetish porn than they do reading a newspaper. They want to use this ""Secret Constitution"" to drive the country back to a time when civility, God, and mom's homemade apple pie were all that mattered.The only problem is, no one can seem to find it . . .So who better to track it down than a private dick who's so down-and-out that he's coming up the other side, a shamus whose only skill is stumbling into every depraved situation imaginable?With no lead to speak of, and no knowledge of the underground world in which the Constitution has traveled, McGill embarks on a cross-country odyssey of America's darkest, dankest underbelly. Along the way, his white-bread sensibilities are treated to a smorgasbord of depravity that runs the gamut of human imagination. The filth mounts; it is clear that this isn't the kind of life, liberty, or happiness that Thomas Jefferson thought Americans would enjoy in the twenty-first century.But what McGill learns as he closes in on the real Constitution is that freedom takes many forms, the most important of which may be the fight against the ""good old days.""

With precise comedic timing and an eye toward lascivious detail, Sorrentino is the perfect guide through this deliciously absurd world. Gilbert Sorrentino has published over 20 books of fiction and poetry, including the story collection, The Moon in Its Flight , and the recent novel, Little Casino , which was shortlisted for the 2003 PEN/Faulkner Award.

Koba the Dread: Laughter and the Twenty Million,Martin Amis,"1,887",ratings202,"January 1, 2002","A brilliant weave of personal involvement, vivid biography and political insight, Koba the Dread is the successor to Martin Amis’s award-winning memoir, Experience.Koba the Dread captures the appeal of one of the most powerful belief systems of the 20th century — one that spread through the world, both captivating it and staining it red. It addresses itself to the central lacuna of 20th-century thought: the indulgence of Communism by the intellectuals of the West. In between the personal beginnings and the personal ending, Amis gives us perhaps the best one-hundred pages ever written about Stalin: Koba the Dread, Iosif the Terrible.The author’s father, Kingsley Amis, though later reactionary in tendency, was a “Comintern dogsbody” (as he would come to put it) from 1941 to 1956. His second-closest, and then his closest friend (after the death of the poet Philip Larkin), was Robert Conquest, our leading Sovietologist whose book of 1968, The Great Terror, was second only to Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago in undermining the USSR. The present memoir explores these connections.Stalin said that the death of one person was tragic, the death of a million a mere “statistic.” Koba the Dread, during whose course the author absorbs a particular, a familial death, is a rebuttal of Stalin’s aphorism.From the Hardcover edition.","306 pages, Paperback",History,"2,786 follower",202 reviews,91,36 (1%),112 (5%),465 (24%),750 (39%),524 (27%)

Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America,James Webb,"1,769",ratings250,"January 1, 2004","More than 27 million Americans today can trace their lineage to the Scots, whose bloodline was stained by centuries of continuous warfare along the border between England and Scotland, and later in the bitter settlements of England’s Ulster Plantation in Northern Ireland. Between 250,000 and 400,000 Scots-Irish migrated to America in the eighteenth century, traveling in groups of families and bringing with them not only long experience as rebels and outcasts but also unparalleled skills as frontiersmen and guerrilla fighters. Their cultural identity reflected acute individualism, dislike of aristocracy and a military tradition, and, over time, the Scots-Irish defined the attitudes and values of the military, of working class America, and even of the peculiarly populist form of American democracy itself.Born Fighting is the first book to chronicle the full journey of this remarkable cultural group, and the profound, but unrecognized, role it has played in the shaping of America. Written with the storytelling verve that has earned his works such acclaim as “captivating . . . unforgettable” (the Wall Street Journal on Lost Soliders ), Scots-Irishman James Webb, Vietnam combat veteran and former Naval Secretary, traces the history of his people, beginning nearly two thousand years ago at Hadrian’s Wall, when the nation of Scotland was formed north of the Wall through armed conflict in contrast to England’s formation to the south through commerce and trade. Webb recounts the Scots’ odyssey—their clashes with the English in Scotland and then in Ulster, their retreat from one war-ravaged land to another. Through engrossing chronicles of the challenges the Scots-Irish faced, Webb vividly portrays how they developed the qualities that helped settle the American frontier and define the American character.Born Fighting shows that the Scots-Irish were 40 percent of the Revolutionary War army; they included the pioneers Daniel Boone, Lewis and Clark, Davy Crockett, and Sam Houston; they were the writers Edgar Allan Poe and Mark Twain; and they have given America numerous great military leaders, including Stonewall Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, Audie Murphy, and George S. Patton, as well as most of the soldiers of the Confederacy (only 5 percent of whom owned slaves, and who fought against what they viewed as an invading army). It illustrates how the Scots-Irish redefined American politics, creating the populist movement and giving the country a dozen presidents, including Andrew Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton. And it explores how the Scots-Irish culture of isolation, hard luck, stubbornness, and mistrust of the nation’s elite formed and still dominates blue-collar America, the military services, the Bible Belt, and country music.Both a distinguished work of cultural history and a human drama that speaks straight to the heart of contemporary America, Born Fighting reintroduces America to its most powerful, patriotic, and individualistic cultural group—one too often ignored or taken for granted.","384 pages, Paperback",History,112 follower,250 reviews,142,62 (3%),128 (7%),406 (22%),622 (35%),551 (31%)
The Complete Quotations of Friedrich Nietzsche,Friedrich Nietzsche,64,ratings4,"December 31, 2013","Philosopher, man of Dynamite and self-confessed AntiChrist, Friedrich Nietzsche has become famous- or perhaps infamous- as probably the most radical and influential thinker of the 20th Century.The Complete quotations of Friedrich Nietzsche is an ideal introduction to Nietzsche’s thought for those seeking an immediate and easily digestible understanding of Nietzsche and his message. The very best way of gaining such an understanding is to read the the works themselves! This book is aimed squarely at the introductory reader– it is not an academic or scholarly text. It is meant to entertain, to illuminate and to provide an authentic flavour of Nietzsche. The book is designed to be read cover to cover in a single day. This text is the result of a two year project to select the most illuminating and easily digestible key messages from Nietzsche. The book contains over 500 carefully selected “bite sized” quotations and occasional longer excerpts from all Nietzsche’s works including Notebooks, unpublished works and correspondence. The book covers not only core philosophical questions such as Free Will and man’s place in the cosmos, but also Nietzsche’s thoughts on (amongst other things): The State, Invalids, Charity, Crime, Suicide and Euthanasia, Vegetarianism and Americans.For each such quotation, a reference is provided to the source book and section from which the quotation was taken, thus enabling the reader to explore further where desired.Nietzsche fights a one man war on behalf of a humanity in dire need of a reconnection with its true self. Nietzsche’s passionate aim is to provide a pathway that will elevate mankind beyond the merely human and into the heights of Nietzsche’s envisioned Human 2.0: the Uberman. This path involves the unmasking and unwinding of the forces that seek to keep humanity from realising its full potential. His writings are passionate, brilliant blasts against the forces of Nihilism, Decadence and Religion.Nietzsche writings are honest to the point of harshness. His debunking of the modern ideals of Equality, Fraternity, Compassion and Moral righteousness are without doubt very politically incorrect, even by the standards of today. Nietzsche pulls no punches and requires a reader who is open to and appreciative of being challenged on all fronts.However, for such readers, beyond the harshness and challenge they will also find one of the most human and impassioned voices of the modern age, and a lifelong companion and guide for a modern, secular outlook on life.Lexido publishes key texts that seek to make Friedrich Nietzsche’s works as accessible as possible to the broadest range of modern readers with the object of promoting an understanding and development of the modern secular society.
