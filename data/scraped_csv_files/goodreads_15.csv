Evolutionary Enlightenment: A New Path to Spiritual Awakening,Andrew Cohen,188,ratings14,"First published September 27, 2011","THE NEW SPIRITUALITY IS ALL ABOUT EVOLUTION    In Evolutionary Enlightenment: A New Path to Spiritual Awakening, Cohen redefines spirituality for our contemporary world* a world characterized by exponential change and an ever-expanding appreciation for the processes of evolution. Based on 25 years of groundbreaking work as a spiritual teacher and the editor-in-chief of the award-winning EnlightenNext magazine, Cohen has synthesized an original path, practice, and philosophy focused entirely on aligning yourself with what he calls * the evolutionary impulse.*  His message is simple, yet profound: Life is evolution, and enlightenment is about waking up to this fundamentally creative impulse as your own deepest, most authentic self* so that you can play an active role in creating the future.  EMBRACING CHANGE AS YOUR SPIRITUAL PRACTICE  Change is a constant in today* 's world. Technology is accelerating, globalization is making the world more and more complex, and the pace of life seems to be speeding up every day.  While many popular forms of contemporary spirituality offer ways to feel better in the face of overwhelming change* to discover greater equanimity, detachment, or compassion* Andrew Cohen says that change is not something to be avoided, or merely tolerated, but an essential aspect of reality that needs to be consciously embraced.  Through his five fundamental tenets for living an enlightened life, Cohen empowers you to wholeheartedly participate in the process of change as your own spiritual practice. In doing so, he not only makes deep sense of life today; he shows you how to play an active role in shaping the world of tomorrow.","213 pages, Hardcover",Spirituality,36 followers,14 reviews,96 books36 followers,8 (4%),8 (4%),37 (19%),66 (35%),69 (36%)

In ""The Wife of the Dictator,"" that eponymous wife (""brought back . . . from [the dictator's] last visit to America"") grows more desperately, menacingly isolated every day. In ""Delicate Edible Birds,"" a group of war correspondents--a lone, high-spirited woman among them--falls sudden prey to a brutal farmer while fleeing Nazis in the French countryside. In ""Lucky Chow Fun,"" Groff returns us to Templeton, the setting of her first book, for revelations about the darkness within even that idyllic small town. In some of these stories, enormous changes happen in an instant. In others, transformations occur across a lifetime--or several lifetimes. Throughout the collection, Groff displays particular and vivid preoccupations. Crime is a motif--sex crimes, a possible murder, crimes of the heart. Love troubles recur--they're in every story--love in alcoholism, in adultery, in a flood, even in the great flu epidemic of 1918. Some of the love has depths, which are understood too late; some of the love is shallow, and also understood too late. And mastery is a theme--Groff's women swim and baton twirl, become poets, or try and try again to achieve the inner strength to exercise personal freedom. Overall, these stories announce a notable new literary master. Dazzlingly original and confident, Delicate Edible Birds further solidifies Groff's reputation as one of the foremost talents of her generation.","306 pages, Hardcover",Short Stories,"6,168 followers",635 reviews,"54 books6,168 followers",69 (1%),212 (4%),"1,033 (19%)","2,185 (41%)","1,769 (33%)"

He is my idol."" ― Malcolm Gladwell ""Dave Hill speaks, rocks, and now writes with a voice so powerful and funny and compelling that I'm pretty sure he's channeling some weird god from another dimension. Basically, this dude is a comedic Cthulhu, and when you read this book, you will either go COMPLETELY MAD or BECOME A SLAVE TO HIS MAD GENIUS. Pray for the latter."" ― John Hodgman""This book should affirm Dave Hill's rightful place as a major American humor writer. You will laugh. Buy two and brighten a friend's life as well."" ― Dick CavettFrom the Book Dear ridiculously attractive person who just so happens to be holding Tasteful Nudes in his or her soft and supple yet commanding hands, Hi. My name is Dave, and this is my very first collection of essays. As you can probably imagine, it pretty much has everything. In fact, if you like stories about stolen meat, animal attacks, young love, death, naked people, clergymen, rock 'n' roll, irritable Canadians, and prison, you have just hit a street called Easy because my book talks about all that stuff and a bunch of other stuff, too. Getting back to that prison thing for a second―I can think of almost no better place to read my book than from within the confines of a correctional facility. For starters, you will definitely have the time. Also, cozying up with a good book in front of your fellow inmates is a great way to show them a softer side that for some reason no one ever wants to hear about in the yard. Fear not, though, non-convicts, my book makes for a solid read outside of prison, too. At the beach, on the subway, while whitewater rafting, during couples counseling, under local anesthesia―I have personally seen to it that my book is totally readable in all these scenarios, as well as in most other scenarios out there today. It will make you laugh, cry, and maybe even think so much that you will forget all your problems while simultaneously creating a few new ones. In limited instances it has been known to cause severe dehydration and the occasional groin pull, but honestly I don't know what that's about. That said, it's probably not a bad idea to keep a glass of water handy and really stretch things out before strapping yourself in for a literary thrill ride you will want to experience again and again until you are either dead or your eyesight fails completely, whichever comes first. In fact, if I end up being wrong about any of this stuff, you can kick me right in the privates. Also, I will send you a nice ham (serves twenty). In short, you really can't lose on this one.

Until he finally sees his chance to escape, and with one desperate gamble risks everything to come back home to the only person he ever loved, and to unlock the secret that has kept him silent for so long. Steve Hamilton steps away from his Edgar Award-winning Alex McKnight series to introduce a unique new character, unlike anyone you've ever seen in the world of crime fiction.","304 pages, Hardcover",Fiction,"1,546 followers","1,511 reviews","57 books1,546 followers",275 (1%),658 (4%),"2,732 (19%)","5,861 (42%)","4,276 (30%)"
Fahrenheit 451: The Authorized Adaptation,Tim Hamilton,"18,226","ratings1,184","First published October 19, 1953","""Monday burn Millay, Wednesday Whitman, Friday Faulkner, burn 'em to ashes, then burn the ashes.""For Guy Montag, a career fireman for whom kerosene is perfume, this is not just an official slogan. It is a mantra, a duty, a way of life in a tightly monitored world where thinking is dangerous and books are forbidden.In 1953, Ray Bradbury envisioned one of the world's most unforgettable dystopian futures, and in Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, the artist Tim Hamilton translates this frightening modern masterpiece into a gorgeously imagined graphic novel. As could only occur with Bradbury's full cooperation in this authorized adaptation, Hamilton has created a striking work of art that uniquely captures Montag's awakening to the evil of government-controlled thought and the inestimable value of philosophy, theology, and literature.Including an original foreword by Ray Bradbury and fully depicting the brilliance and force of his canonic and beloved masterwork, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is an exceptional, haunting work of graphic literature.","151 pages, Paperback",Graphic Novels,18 followers,"1,184 reviews",75 books18 followers,391 (2%),"1,054 (5%)","4,234 (23%)","6,815 (37%)","5,732 (31%)"
"Galloping with Light - Einstein, Relativity, and Folklore",Felix Alba-Juez,11,ratings2,"First published January 1, 2009","Tired of popular science books written by renowned physicists who think you cannot comprehend what they do, so... all you deserve is the illusion of understanding? If yes, this is the book for you. The fact that the reader may not have a scientific education does not mean that s/he does not have the intelligence to understand profound concepts -- as long as they are presented with semantic and epistemological clarity. After all, Einstein said that Science is simply the refinement of our intuition and everyday experiences. Galloping with Light is a symbolic cavalcade that starts with the discovery of fire 1.5 million years ago; it allegorically employs the imagination of an adolescent called Einstein to explain the Theory of Relativity in non-scientific terms, and ends with the Apollo 11 landing on the Moon in 1969 -- depositing on lunar soil a laser retro-reflector which would prove, once again, that Einstein was right. Motivated by his own difficulties to understand Relativity Theory, and convinced that it is possible to teach the layperson without distorting the subject matter, the author takes an approach utterly opposed to that of most popular science books. Knowing he has to demolish what the reader understands by time, distance, and motion, the author -using his experiences as a child, adolescent, and adult- dedicates the first half of the book to convince the reader that our intuition and common sense, as applied to those three everyday concepts, have a foundation as solid as that of a castle on the sand. The purpose of this book is to demystify and 'defolklorize' the reader; to destroy the aura of mystery and incomprehensibility surrounding Relativity Theory, unmasking and debunking the body of popular (and scientific) beliefs (mostly erroneous) which -taking advantage of the confusion between relativity and subjectivity, as well as of Einstein's popularity and prestige- have been used to validate preposterous assertions in fields like psychology, morality, spirituality, sociology, literature, art, etc.Editorial ReviewsA remarkable book. You have ""galloped with light"" very astutely and imaginatively! Besides being a thorough student of your subject, you are also a skilled pedagogue of it! -- Adolf Grünbaum, Author of Philosophical Problems of Space and Time and The Foundations of Psychoanalysis: A Philosophic Critique.I'm impressed at your pedagogical capability to explain advanced physics with words (almost) only. An absolutely fascinating reading, a cultural Odyssey through the roots of physics. -- Matts Roos, Author of ""Introduction to Cosmology""A delightful treat for the inquisitive mind. -- Raj Rajamani, Professor, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.By reading this book anyone can comprehend Einstein's concepts and implications and, at the end, one would like to start all over. -- Manuel Toharia Cortés, Scientific Director of 'Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias' (Spain)An introduction intellectually accessible and literarily enchanting to the Theory of Relativity. -- Jesús Zamora Bonilla, Professor of Philosophy of Science (UNED, Spain)If this reviewer was teaching a course in physics at the college level, Mr. Alba-Juez's book would be an absolute must on the course reading list. -- Donn Gurney (BookReview.com).An excellent pick that blends humor, common sense, and knowledge into one entertaining package, highly recommended. -- Michael J. Carson (Midwest Book Review).From the AuthorAt the beginning of 2008, I started my dream of finishing my life explaining the most profound concepts in Science to the big public, and decided to start doing so by writing this book about Einstein, Relativity, and Folklore. By Folklore, I mean the set of popular (and scientific) beliefs, mostly erroneous, associated with Relativity Theory and with our scientific activity in general. In this new project as a writer of Popular Science, my objective is to reach the mass reader, that non-scientific person with the curiosity of understanding the Universe in which we live, who has the habit of reading and thinking and the respect for her/his own capacity of logical analysis and comprehension, and who is conscious of the relevance Science carries in current society, and the essential role it plays as a modeler of our destiny as a biological species.Around my 14 years of age I avidly read a little book on Relativity Theory without understanding a thing. However, I was perplexed, because the three concepts about which the author elaborated upon over and over were precisely those which every 14-year kid had to be already intimately familiarized with, by the sheer fact of growing up: time, distance, and speed. What did I learn from that frustrating juvenile experience? That the author expected me to employ what every one of us (even adults) understands by time, distance, and speed to reach conclusions which only could be considered untrue and preposterous precisely because, had we considered them credible and sensible, we would have been compelled to throw away our millenary understanding of those three cherished concepts. What a peculiar approach, I said to myself: if the conclusion is going to destroy our deepest convictions, why not start analyzing those convictions, attempting to grasp the experiences, basic principles, and hypotheses that made us erroneously though vehemently believe in them for thousands of years?What the non-scientific reader needs (as well as the scientist) is a book giving more importance to the intuitive physical meaning of the words than to the unmeasured erudition an author can display with them. My objective thus is not to turn the reader into an expert in Relativity; on the contrary: that would require a much bigger effort than simply reading this book. My purpose is to show that the Theory of Relativity, experimentally confirmed in the last hundred years, regardless of how strange and opposed to our prejudices (disguised in the mask of 'common sense') may seem to be, is rational, consistent, and intelligible for the layperson -- if, and only if, s/he has the audacity of accepting the unfounded nature of those preconceptions. It is my desire and the honor of stimulating in the non-specialized person such a necessary intellectual boldness that have motivated me to write this book. These intellectual strength and courage have nothing to do with our academic or professional credentials; even more: had I believed they are strictly necessary to seize a concrete and positive message out of this book, I would have not gone through the trouble of writing it. I thus dream for the reader finishing this book with the sensation that it is possible to achieve an acceptable understanding of the Theory of Relativity based on the objective truth and free of folklore (popular as well as scientific). And... if, after some time, the reader feels the urge to read my book again so as to strengthen his/her understanding, my ephemeral stay in Plato's cave will have had the sense and transcendence that all of us seek for our existence.From the Back Cover""...an introduction, intellectually accessible and literarily enchanting, to one of the principal components of the scaffold scientists have built for the current understanding of the Universe: the Theory of Relativity."" Jesús Zamora Bonilla, Full Professor of Philosophy of Science at the UNED (Madrid, Spain)""...By reading this book anyone can comprehend the immensity of Einstein's concepts and implications. And not only that: it is read with gusto and at the end one would like to start all over; in part just for the mere pleasure of it, but mostly because there is profound philosophical content throughout the book.""Manuel Toharia Cortés, Scientific Director of the 'Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias' (Valencia, Spain)","326 pages, Paperback",Physics,33 followers,2 reviews,13 books33 followers,0 (0%),1 (9%),2 (18%),3 (27%),5 (45%)

On The Intuitive Spectrum: A Deeper Look into the Amazing Value of Intuition,Susan Ozimkiewicz,6,ratings3,"First published July 2, 2012","The sun god Apollo sentenced Cassandra to be able to prophesy her intuitions but to never be believed. Since ancient times, the gift of prophecy and intuition was a present that was bestowed upon Cassandra by Apollo. Apollo loved Cassandra, and she rejected Apollo’s advances toward her. Hence, because she rejected Apollo, this curse is still, in effect, today. Even in the modern-day world intuition is rarely believed or trusted because there is no proof or guarantee. Only after the intuition was seen to be correct do you say, “Oh, if only I had listened to my intuition.” Susan invites you to explore the depth of intuition with her and discover its worth to you. Perhaps, reminding you that you always wondered about your own intuition but brushed it away and might now reclaim it as a useful tool. A variety of readers will be interested in this book, including therapists, their patients, students of psychology, Jungian scholars, and people of all ages. This book is an exploration and an invitation to everyone to begin to discern and explore within themselves their own subtle intuitive sense perceptions as a cultural value and a personal transformative power.","136 pages, Paperback",Nonfiction,3 followers,3 reviews,2 books3 followers,1 (16%),0 (0%),0 (0%),2 (33%),3 (50%)
Fisheye,Trish Thorpe,233,ratings29,"First published October 2, 2012","Written with the taut, plot-driven momentum of a fictional yarn, this true story reveals an insider's intimate details of the California dream gone horribly wrong.Wedged between talkative, fidgety older brother Spencer (more equipped to interact with electronics than people) and younger sister Grace (a bubbly, pink-sequined, girly girl), tomboy Trish grew into the family golden child - ;unwittingly providing fuel for her narcissist father's cruelty. Add an alcoholic wannabe movie star mom and a Southern California community full of itself like no other and you have the ingredients for an unforgettable story.Life for the author and her siblings ricocheted between forced conversations with beautiful people and a house rife with deafening silence. Eventually dreams of stardom eroded, tension became unbearable, and the family imploded. That was just the beginning.Left on her own, Trish descended into a desperate world of addiction and risk—both physical and emotional—unimaginable from the spoiled, fantasy life of her childhood. A nineteen-year-old boyfriend introduced her to sex at thirteen and became her gateway into a world that her parents never could have imagined. You'll find yourself shaking your head in wonder as Trish uses her wide-angle (fisheye) observations to guide us through jaw-dropping experiences.With remarkably adept word craft from a debut author, Thorpe explores issues that are both intensely private and startlingly universal.

Yes there are elements of this story that appeal to us individually, but Thorpe's triumphant emancipation from her past belongs to us all.Note: The author successfully weaves allusions to the Wonderful Wizard of Oz throughout her own odyssey. You'll find references to Dorothy's journey of self-discovery, replete with all the colorful characters and settings of the original parable.","210 pages, Paperback",Memoir,44 followers,29 reviews,5 books44 followers,32 (13%),50 (21%),58 (24%),42 (18%),51 (21%)

Smith,16,ratings4,"First published May 5, 2011","Father Joseph is a devout priest with a sad but inspirational backstory living in Rome when he stumbles upon a well guarded ancient scroll shrouded in secrecy at the Vatican. It was written, he learns, over two thousand years ago by a man believed by a select few to have been a mysterious thirteenth apostle of Christ. When the disturbing prophecies of the scroll are revealed to Father Joseph he is certain the end of days for man is here and he is compelled to embark upon a journey around the world on a quest to save the soul of mankind. He is unaware that Glenn, an angel from the highest order of heaven, has already descended to earth to determine whether man has finally and completely emptied his soul of purity of heart of his own free will. If so, man’s demise is imminent. Glenn’s work is interrupted when the underworld sends Falene to place a well thought out, diabolical wager with the angel; find the last soul on earth with the purest of heart then turn him or her over to her to be tested. In no other way could the true resolve of mankind be measured. Glenn accepts the bet. If he loses, then all of humanity will be turned over to hell, the abode of the devils where the wicked dwell. When the chosen one is selected as the ultimate representative for all and stripped to his or her core and put to tests a hero would beg to be spared, can he or she rise up against evil in it’s most intimidating form to prove that goodness still exists within the heart of mankind?
