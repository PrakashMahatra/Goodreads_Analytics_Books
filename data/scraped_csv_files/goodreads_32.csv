The Trip to Echo Spring,Olivia Laing,"3,316",ratings507,"First published August 1, 2013","Why is it that some of the greatest works of literature have been produced by writers in the grip of alcoholism, an addiction that cost them personal happiness and caused harm to those who loved them? In The Trip to Echo Spring, Olivia Laing examines the link between creativity and alcohol through the work and lives of six extraordinary men: F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Tennessee Williams, John Berryman, John Cheever, and Raymond Carver. All six of these writers were alcoholics, and the subject of drinking surfaces in some of their finest work, from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof to A Moveable Feast. Often they did their drinking together—Hemingway and Fitzgerald ricocheting through the cafés of 1920s Paris; Carver and Cheever speeding to the liquor store in Iowa in the icy winter of 1973.Olivia Laing grew up in an alcoholic family herself. One spring, wanting to make sense of this ferocious, entangling disease, she took a journey across America that plunged her into the heart of these overlapping lives. As she travels from Cheever's New York to Williams' New Orleans, from Hemingway's Key West to Carver's Port Angeles, she pieces together a topographical map of alcoholism, from the horrors of addiction to the miraculous possibilities of recovery. Beautiful, captivating and original, The Trip to Echo Spring strips away the myth of the alcoholic writer to reveal the terrible price creativity can exert.","340 pages, Hardcover",Nonfiction,"2,319 followers",507 reviews,"22 books2,319 followers",70 (2%),255 (7%),906 (27%),"1,333 (40%)",752 (22%)

"Van Gogh's Untold Journey: Revelations of faith, family, & Artistic Inspiration",William J. Havlicek,21,ratings7,"First published January 1, 2010","William J. Havlicek’s revealing book is based largely on Vincent van Gogh’s astonishing letters of which over 900 exist. This important work—the result of over 15 years of research—provides new insight into the artist’s true character nurtured from his abiding faith, the influence of family, and the tender solicitude he felt for mankind. Havlicek’s book holds some compelling revelations, among them the role played by Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, his sister-in-law, without whom little of the inimitable Vincent would ever have been known; and the artist’s vicarious relationship with Charles Dickens. But perhaps most revealing is Havlicek’s discovery of how the inspired words of Victor Hugo, embodied in one of his characters in Les Misérables, gave Van Gogh the idea for one of his most celebrated paintings of all The Starry Night. This particular revelation is sure to astound the art world. The book also dispels much of the myth that has come to surround Vincent’s tumultuous life. In the words of the author, the book illuminates instead “…an unknown, adventurous, deeply compassionate man whose essence seems to have been lost in the dramatic and often apocryphal stories surrounding his illness and early death. My effort is to resurrect an unknown aspect of Vincent—one that is even heroic and certainly praiseworthy…”.","284 pages, Paperback",Art,4 followers,7 reviews,1 book4 followers,2 (9%),0 (0%),5 (23%),6 (28%),8 (38%)

For example, some gnostic texts suggest that god should be celebrated as both mother and father, and that self-knowledge is the supreme path to the divine. Only in the past fifty years has it become clear how far the gnostic influence spread in ancient and medieval religions—and what a marvelous body of scriptures it produced. The selections gathered here, in poetic, readable translation, represent Jewish, Christian, Hermetic, Mandaean, Manichaean, Islamic, and Cathar expressions of gnostic spirituality.

Sex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality,Christopher  Ryan,"29,788","ratings2,767","First published June 29, 2010","Since Darwin's day, we've been told that sexual monogamy comes naturally to our species. Mainstream science--as well as religious and cultural institutions--has maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a man's possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman's fertility and fidelity. But this narrative is collapsing. Fewer and fewer couples are getting married, and divorce rates keep climbing as adultery and flagging libido drag down even seemingly solid marriages.How can reality be reconciled with the accepted narrative? It can't be, according to renegade thinkers Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá. While debunking almost everything we ""know"" about sex, they offer a bold alternative explanation in this provocative and brilliant book.Ryan and Jethá's central contention is that human beings evolved in egalitarian groups that shared food, child care, and, often, sexual partners. Weaving together convergent, frequently overlooked evidence from anthropology, archaeology, primatology, anatomy, and psychosexuality, the authors show how far from human nature monogamy really is. Human beings everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar, intimate situations in surprisingly different ways. The authors expose the ancient roots of human sexuality while pointing toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate capacities for love, cooperation, and generosity.With intelligence, humor, and wonder, Ryan and Jethá show how our promiscuous past haunts our struggles over monogamy, sexual orientation, and family dynamics. They explore why long-term fidelity can be so difficult for so many; why sexual passion tends to fade even as love deepens; why many middle-aged men risk everything for transient affairs with younger women; why homosexuality persists in the face of standard evolutionary logic; and what the human body reveals about the prehistoric origins of modern sexuality.In the tradition of the best historical and scientific writing, Sex at Dawn unapologetically upends unwarranted assumptions and unfounded conclusions while offering a revolutionary understanding of why we live and love as we do.","416 pages, Hardcover",Nonfiction,896 followers,"2,767 reviews",9 books896 followers,905 (3%),"1,741 (5%)","5,492 (18%)","10,613 (35%)","11,037 (37%)"

Di una coppia felice e inesperta, spaventata di scoprire, giorno dopo giorno, le molteplici forme dell’abbandono. Perché anche le famiglie possono soffrire di solitudine, proprio come le persone. Ad accudire in silenzio tutte le incertezze, oltre a prendersi cura del loro bambino, ci ha sempre pensato la signora A. Per questo, quando arriva un male a portarsela via, si spalanca in casa un vuoto improvviso. Nora e suo marito devono ancora accorgersi che il coraggio della signora A., ormai, appartiene anche a loro.È dentro le stanze che le famiglie crescono: strepitanti, incerte, allegre, spaventate. Giovani coppie alle prime armi, pronte ad abbracciarsi o a perdersi. Come Nora e suo marito. Ma di quelle stanze bisogna prima o poi spalancare porte e finestre, aprirsi al tempo che passa, all’aria di fuori. «A lungo andare ogni amore ha bisogno di qualcuno che lo veda e riconosca, che lo avvalori, altrimenti rischia di essere scambiato per un malinteso». È cosí che la signora A., nell'attimo stesso in cui entra in casa per occuparsi delle faccende domestiche, diventa la custode di una relazione, la bussola per orientarsi nella bonaccia e nella burrasca. Con le pantofole allineate accanto alla porta e gli scontrini esatti al centesimo, l’appropriazione indebita della cucina e i pochi tesori di una sua vita segreta, appare fin da subito solida, testarda, magica, incrollabile. «La signora A. era la sola vera testimone dell’impresa che compivamo giorno dopo giorno, la sola testimone del legame che ci univa. Senza il suo sguardo ci sentivamo in pericolo». Ci sono molti modi per raccontare una storia d’amore.

The police guard the room and the identity of the patient is kept secret.Once again Jo Nesbø delivers a devilishly clever story about the scope of human evil; a cat-and-mouse game that involves not only the victims and the police, but also the reader.","436 pages, Hardcover",Crime,21k followers,"3,124 reviews",145 books21k followers,322 (<1%),981 (2%),"5,698 (12%)","18,495 (41%)","19,058 (42%)"
Tilt-a-Whirl,Chris Grabenstein,"3,488",ratings401,"First published August 31, 2005","There isn't much sun in the fun when a billionaire real estate tycoon is found murdered on the Tilt-A-Whirl at a seedy seaside amusement park in the otherwise quiet summer tourist town of Sea Haven. John Ceepak, a former MP just back from Iraq, has just joined the Sea Haven police department. The job offer came from an old army buddy who hoped to give Ceepak at least a summer's worth of rest and relaxation to help him forget the horrors of war. Instead, Ceepak will head up the murder investigation. He is partnered with Danny Boyle, a 24-year-old part-time summer cop who doesn't carry a gun and only works with the police by day so he has enough pocket money left over to play with his beach buddies at night. In the first novel in a new series written in the spirit of Carl Hiaasen's work, the Tilt-A-Whirl murder pushes Ceepak's deep sense of honor and integrity to the limits, as unexpected twists and turns keep the truth spinning wildly in every direction.","330 pages, Paperback",Mystery,"2,347 followers",401 reviews,"139 books2,347 followers",70 (2%),202 (5%),954 (27%),"1,515 (43%)",747 (21%)
Public Information,Rolf Margenau,349,ratings11,"First published June 24, 2011","Freshly minted infantryman, twenty-year-old Wylie Cypher, arrives in war torn Korea in 1952. Every indication is that he has limited chances for survival. As an enemy bomber looms overhead, he prays that he can survive a sixteen-month tour of duty without, as his sergeant says, getting his ass shot off.Wylie is recruited to join the staff of a Division Public Information Office (PIO) where he reports on many aspects of the conflict. He uses his infantry training in bloody combat, makes many colorful new friends, learns how to maneuver through the military system, finds love and loss, and grows up in the turmoil of combat and the war’s aftermath.Veterans have hailed the story as accurate, believable, touching, funny, and “the way it really was.” The story is based on the author’s experiences, careful historical research, and the 300 letters he sent his future wife from Korea. He touches on prisoner of war experiences on both sides of the DMZ, the armistice, realistic scenes of combat, the many United Nations forces engaged in the war, and poignant and funny aspects of military service. The second edition of the book includes recently disclosed information, and scenes and observations drawn from the comments of many veteran readers. The book is dedicated to the dwindling number of men and women who risked their lives to preserve democracy in South Korea.","407 pages, Kindle Edition",War,100 followers,11 reviews,9 books100 followers,0 (0%),0 (0%),66 (18%),159 (45%),124 (35%)
