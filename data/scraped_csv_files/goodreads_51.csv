Anger Is My Middle Name: A Memoir,Lisbeth Zornig Andersen,"1,841",ratings132,"November 11, 2011","An empowering memoir of resilience and redemption, and the rage that helped a girl escape the darkness of a harrowing childhood.Born to a violently dysfunctional home in working-class Denmark, Lisbeth Zornig Andersen and her three older brothers were bounced between foster care and state-run institutions, then back again to their chemically dependent mother and sadistic stepfather. For Lisbeth, it was a childhood without perimeters. It was blighted by poverty, sexual abuse, neglect, betrayal, and further victimization by the broken Danish social services system that forced Lisbeth to live where and how it saw fit. Coming of age with a myriad of fears and emotional disorders, Lisbeth had three things that would become driving forces in her life: she was extraordinarily bright, extremely willful, and exceptionally angry.From hell to liberation, this is Lisbeth’s emotional and galvanizing memoir told in two voices: that of a young girl who was unwanted, challenged, and defiant, and that of a woman who channeled her rage into a positive force as a passionate advocate for children’s rights. Whatever darkness defines the past, it can be used to change the future. Lisbeth’s heart-wrenching and ultimately uplifting journey is proof.","230 pages, Hardcover",Nonfiction,25 follower,132 reviews,12,20 (1%),56 (3%),339 (18%),688 (37%),738 (40%)

Hired by families as a last resort, he requires only a single object to find the person who has vanished. When he takes on the case of Maggie St. James—a well-known author of dark, macabre children’s books—he’s led to a place many believed to be only a legend. Called Pastoral, this reclusive community was founded in the 1970s by like-minded people searching for a simpler way of life.

Feminism’s success is down to complicated, contradictory, imperfect women, who fought each other as well as fighting for equal rights. Helen Lewis argues that too many of these pioneers have been whitewashed or forgotten in our modern search for feel-good, inspirational heroines. It’s time to reclaim the history of feminism as a history of difficult women.In this book, you’ll meet the working-class suffragettes who advocated bombings and arson; the princess who discovered why so many women were having bad sex; the pioneer of the refuge movement who became a men’s rights activist; the ‘striker in a sari’ who terrified Margaret Thatcher; the wronged Victorian wife who definitely wasn’t sleeping with the prime minister; and the lesbian politician who outraged the country. Taking the story up to the present with the twenty-first-century campaign for abortion services, Helen Lewis reveals the unvarnished – and unfinished – history of women’s rights.Drawing on archival research and interviews, Difficult Women is a funny, fearless and sometimes shocking narrative history, which shows why the feminist movement has succeeded – and what it should do next.

In August 2008, NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) issued its report on WTC 7, declaring that ""the reason for the collapse of World Trade Center 7 is no longer a mystery"" and that ""science is really behind what we have said."" Showing that neither of these claims is true, David Ray Griffin demonstrates that NIST is guilty of the most serious types of scientific fraud: fabricating, falsifying, and ignoring evidence. He also shows that NIST's report left intact the central mystery: How could a building damaged by fire - not explosives - have come down in free fall?","328 pages, Paperback",Conspiracy Theories,73 follower,9 reviews,74,4 (6%),3 (4%),10 (15%),15 (23%),32 (50%)
God Is Closer Than You Think,John Ortberg,"1,909",ratings110,"March 4, 2005","Two works of art help John Ortberg think about the presence of God. One is Michelangelo Buonarroti’s brilliant painting of God and Adam on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. God is close. His hand comes within a hair’s breath of the hand of the man. It seems to say that God is closer than we think—he’s here, now, today, accessible to all who will but “lift a finger.” The second work of art is Martin Hanford’s cartoon character Waldo. He is on every page of the Where’s Waldo? books, but he can be difficult to find. In the same way, even though God is present on every page of our lives, he’s often not easy to spot.In God Is Closer Than You Think, John Ortberg examines this frustrating paradox of the Christian life. “When it is so easy to ‘see’ God all around me (in trees, in birds, in nature) why is it so hard to feel his presence—especially when I need him most?” Ortberg helps readers discover the secret to living daily in the reality of God’s most frequent promise in Scripture, “I will be with you.”",Audio CD,Christian,574 follower,110 reviews,272,18 (<1%),52 (2%),295 (15%),707 (37%),837 (43%)

The Secret War with Iran: The 30-Year Clandestine Struggle Against the World's Most Dangerous Terrorist Power,Ronen Bergman,291,ratings37,"January 1, 2007","In the years since 9/11, the U.S. war on terror has focused on al-Qaeda, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Coverage of Iran has been devoted almost exclusively to its nuclear ambitions. Yet, as Ronen Bergman's groundbreaking reporting in this vital investigative history reveals, for thirty years, Iran has been the world's leading sponsor of global terror and stands as the most formidable sponsor of terror in the world today. Bergman, one of Israel's top investigative reporters, gained unprecedented access to extra-ordinary sources from top to bottom in the Mossad and intelligence agencies around the world. Based on over ten years of research and more than three hundred exclusive interviews with key intelligence figures, he reveals that Iranian terrorist masterminds have crisscrossed the globe, conducting bombings and assassinations with impunity -- even renting apartments and planning bombing attacks in New York City. Iran's proxy, Hizballah, has virtually taken over southern Lebanon and threatens Israel with high-powered weaponry supplied by Iran. Iran and Hizballah worked closely with al-Qaeda and other Sunni terrorist groups in developing their terrorist operations, and Iranian commandos trained Iraqi insurgents in the crafts of suicide bombing and the building of the roadside bombs that have killed so many U.S. troops in Iraq. In response, and largely beneath the public's radar, a vast clandestine war has been fought with Iran and Hizballah on one side and the CIA, Israel's Mossad, and their European counterparts on the other. The full story of that secret war, told for the first time here, will fundamentally change the debate about U.S. national security priorities. A new axis of evil is emerging from Iran and spreading around the world, and Ronen Bergman shows that the CIA and Mossad have so far been unable to thwart it. The Secret War with Iran is riveting and urgent.","432 pages, Hardcover",History,212 follower,37 reviews,10,8 (2%),17 (5%),66 (22%),124 (42%),76 (26%)

What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank,Nathan Englander,"8,008","ratings1,082","February 7, 2012","These eight new stories from the celebrated novelist and short-story writer Nathan Englander display a gifted young author grappling with the great questions of modern life, with a command of language and the imagination that place Englander at the very forefront of contemporary American fiction. The title story, inspired by Raymond Carver’s masterpiece, is a provocative portrait of two marriages in which the Holocaust is played out as a devastating parlor game. In the outlandishly dark “Camp Sundown” vigilante justice is undertaken by a group of geriatric campers in a bucolic summer enclave. “Free Fruit for Young Widows” is a small, sharp study in evil, lovingly told by a father to a son. “Sister Hills” chronicles the history of Israel’s settlements from the eve of the Yom Kippur War through the present, a political fable constructed around the tale of two mothers who strike a terrible bargain to save a child. Marking a return to two of Englander’s classic themes, “Peep Show” and “How We Avenged the Blums” wrestle with sexual longing and ingenuity in the face of adversity and peril. And “Everything I Know About My Family on My Mother’s Side” is suffused with an intimacy and tenderness that break new ground for a writer who seems constantly to be expanding the parameters of what he can achieve in the short form. Beautiful and courageous, funny and achingly sad, Englander’s work is a revelation.","207 pages, Hardcover",Short Stories,388 follower,"1,082 reviews",55,155 (1%),615 (7%),"2,191 (27%)","3,216 (40%)","1,831 (22%)"
