Outward Bound,Robert A. Heinlein,406,ratings6,"June 1, 2006","""Have Spacesuit Will Travel"": Kip wants to go to the Moon badly. Everything about him is average; his only claim to fame is that he won a contest and now owns an obsolete but fully equipped space suit. One day, he's walking around his back yard testing it out, when a voice comes over the talkie & the next thing he knows, he's onboard a spaceship heading for the very place he dreams about. But this is no dream. For Kip has been captured by a race of monstrous yet highly advanced aliens who see humans as untrained animals...and a good source of protein....""Starship Troopers"": In a far future where military service is voluntary, even discouraged, there is of course a catch: enlist or forfeit full citizenship. Basic training is made particularly harsh so that only those of the highest character will survive. But the logic of this escapes Johnnie Rico, an ordinary kid from a wealthy family. Thinking he's joining a peacetime army, the 18-year-old signs up on a whim and becomes a soldier in the Mobile Infantry where his sergeant tells him, We'll make a man of you or kill you trying. To Johnnie's surprise, he gets through the toughest boot camp in the Universe...just in time to be sent into battle against mankind's most terrifying enemy.""Podkayne of Mars"": Podkayne Fries is a thoroughly modern young Marswoman with a timetable for success based on one goal to be the first female starship captain & she has her strategy all mapped out. So when she gets a chance to travel to Earth with her Uncle Tom, a distinguished elder statesman, Poddy jumps at it...despite the fact that her obnoxiously brilliant kid brother, Clark, is coming along as well. What Poddy doesn't realize is that her uncle is the official Ambassador Plenipotentiary from Mars to the Three-Planets Conference & that certain parties will stop at nothing to gain control of his vote.

When did the world stop wanting to hear? When did society stop valuing basic courtesy and respect? It’s a topic that has been simmering for years, and Lynne Truss says it’s now reached the boiling point. Taking on the boorish behavior that for some has become a point of pride, ""Talk to the Hand"" is a rallying cry for civility. When did ""please"" and ""thank you"" become passé? When you call a ""customer service"" number, why does the burden of deciphering the automatic switchboard fall to you (and where are the real people when you, the customer, need service)? Why do people behave as if public spaces are their own chip-strewn living rooms? Perhaps most important, how has it come to be that we are not allowed to object? Call someone out on rude or disrespectful behaviour and you are likely to get an ""eff off"" or worse. In a recent US survey, 79 per cent of adults said that lack of courtesy was a serious problem. For all of those fed up with antisocial behaviour and suffering in silence, realise that you are the majority!","206 pages, Hardcover",Nonfiction,741 follower,537 reviews,98,182 (5%),545 (15%),"1,258 (36%)","1,009 (28%)",497 (14%)
No Time Like the Present,Nadine Gordimer,631,ratings142,"October 30, 2010","A sharply observed new novel about post-apartheid South Africa from the Nobel Prize winnerNadine Gordimer is one of our most telling contemporary writers. With each new work, she attacks—with a clear-eyed fierceness, a lack of sentimentality, and a deep understanding of the darkest depths of the human soul—her eternal themes: the inextricable link between personal and communal history; the inescapable moral ambiguities of daily life; the political and racial tensions that persist in her homeland, South Africa. And in each new work is fresh evidence of her literary genius: in the sharpness of her psychological insights, the stark beauty of her language, the complexity of her characters, and the difficult choices with which they are faced. In No Time Like the Present, Gordimer trains her keen eye on Steve and Jabulile, an interracial couple living in a newly, tentatively, free South Africa. They have a daughter, Sindiswa; they move to the suburbs; Steve becomes a lecturer at a university; Jabulile trains to become a lawyer; there is another child, a boy this time. There is nothing so extraordinary about their lives, and yet, in telling their story and the stories of their friends and families, Gordimer manages to capture the tortured, fragmented essence of a nation struggling to define itself post-apartheid. The subject is contemporary, but Gordimer’s treatment is, as ever, timeless. In No Time Like the Present, she shows herself once again a master novelist, at the height of her prodigious powers.","432 pages, Kindle Edition",Fiction,854 follower,142 reviews,302,48 (7%),126 (19%),202 (32%),176 (27%),79 (12%)

They weren’t. Having earlier seized control of the vessel and slaughtered most of the crew, they were staging an elaborate ruse, acting as if they were humble servants. When Delano, an idealistic, anti-slavery republican, finally realized the deception, he responded with explosive violence.Drawing on research on four continents, The Empire of Necessity explores the multiple forces that culminated in this extraordinary event—an event that already inspired Herman Melville’s masterpiece Benito Cereno. Now historian Greg Grandin, with the gripping storytelling that was praised in Fordlandia, uses the dramatic happenings of that day to map a new transnational history of slavery in the Americas, capturing the clash of peoples, economies, and faiths that was the New World in the early 1800s.","384 pages, Hardcover",History,365 follower,157 reviews,22,12 (1%),40 (4%),193 (21%),361 (40%),279 (31%)

Africa's legendary City of Gold, not visited by Europeans since the Middle Ages, held the promise of wealth and fame for the first explorer to make it there. In 1824, the French Geographical Society offered a cash prize to the first expedition from any nation to visit Timbuktu and return to tell the tale.One of the contenders was Major Alexander Gordon Laing, a thirty–year–old army officer. Handsome and confident, Laing was convinced that Timbuktu was his destiny, and his ticket to glory. In July 1825, after a whirlwind romance with Emma Warrington, daughter of the British consul at Tripoli, Laing left the Mediterranean coast to cross the Sahara. His 2,000–mile journey took on an added urgency when Hugh Clapperton, a more experienced explorer, set out to beat him. Apprised of each other's mission by overseers in London who hoped the two would cooperate, Clapperton instead became Laing's rival, spurring him on across a hostile wilderness.An emotionally charged, action–packed, utterly gripping read, The Race for Timbuktu offers a close, personal look at the extraordinary people and pivotal events of nineteenth–century African exploration that changed the course of history and the shape of the modern world.","352 pages, Paperback",History,1 book8 follower,50 reviews,1,8 (1%),23 (4%),122 (26%),198 (42%),117 (25%)

The Tinkerer's Accomplice: How Design Emerges from Life Itself,J. Scott Turner,34,ratings6,"January 1, 2007","Most people, when they contemplate the living world, conclude that it is a designed place. So it is jarring when biologists come along and say this is all wrong. What most people see as design, they say--purposeful, directed, even intelligent--is only an illusion, something cooked up in a mind that is eager to see purpose where none exists. In these days of increasingly assertive challenges to Darwinism, the question becomes is our perception of design simply a mental figment, or is there something deeper at work? Physiologist Scott Turner argues eloquently and convincingly that the apparent design we see in the living world only makes sense when we add to Darwin's towering achievement the dimension that much modern molecular biology has left on the gene-splicing the dynamic interaction between living organisms and their environment. Only when we add environmental physiology to natural selection can we begin to understand the beautiful fit between the form life takes and how life works. In The Tinkerer's Accomplice , Scott Turner takes up the question of design as a very real problem in biology; his solution poses challenges to all sides in this critical debate.","304 pages, Hardcover",Science,17 follower,6 reviews,5,0 (0%),0 (0%),8 (23%),10 (29%),16 (47%)

Never. In the book, we watch what happens when his sense of justice and even his sense of self begin to crack--and how his world then slowly devolves. It's a huge, ambitious novel clearly in the vein of DeLillo, Foster Wallace, Pynchon, and even Melville, and it's told in a distinct, frequently hilarious voice, with a striking human empathy at its center. Its panoramic reach takes readers through crime and courts, immigrant families and urban blight, media savagery and media satire, scatology and boxing, and even a breathless heist worthy of anycrime novel. If Infinite Jest stuck a pin in the map of mid-90s culture and drew our trajectory from there, A Naked Singularity does the same for the feeling of surfeit, brokenness, and exhaustion that permeates our civic and cultural life today. In the opening sentence of Gaddis' A Frolic of His Own, a character sneers, ""Justice? You get justice in the next world. In this world, you get the law.""

Across the US, ""500-year"" storms pummel communities month after month, and floods displace tens of millions annually.This is only a preview of the changes to come. And they are coming fast.

"Why Materialism Is Baloney: How true skeptics know there is no death and fathom answers to life, the universe and everything",Bernardo Kastrup,598,ratings76,"April 25, 2014","The present framing of the cultural debate in terms of materialism versus religion has allowed materialism to go unchallenged as the only rationally-viable metaphysics. This book seeks to change this. It uncovers the absurd implications of materialism and then, uniquely, presents a hard-nosed non-materialist metaphysics substantiated by skepticism, hard empirical evidence, and clear logical argumentation. It lays out a coherent framework upon which one can interpret and make sense of every natural phenomenon and physical law, as well as the modalities of human consciousness, without materialist assumptions. According to this framework, the brain is merely the image of a self-localization process of mind, analogously to how a whirlpool is the image of a self-localization process of water. The brain doesn't generate mind in the same way that a whirlpool doesn't generate water. It is the brain that is in mind, not mind in the brain. Physical death is merely a de-clenching of awareness. The book closes with a series of educated speculations regarding the afterlife, psychic phenomena, and other related subjects.","239 pages, Paperback",Philosophy,474 follower,76 reviews,14,19 (3%),24 (4%),78 (13%),174 (29%),303 (50%)

Egeus, the Duke’s minister, is furious that his daughter Hermia is determined to marry Demetrius, instead of Lysander, the man he has chosen for her. The Duke decrees that if, by the time of the wedding, Hermia still refuses to marry Lysander, she shall be executed . . . or consigned to a nunnery. Pocket, being Pocket, cannot help but point out that this decree is complete bollocks, and that the Duke is an egregious weasel for having even suggested it. Irritated by the fool’s impudence, the Duke orders his death. With the Duke’s guards in pursuit, Pocket makes a daring escape.He soon stumbles into the wooded realm of the fairy king Oberon, who, as luck would have it, IS short a fool. His jester Robin Goodfellow—the mischievous sprite better known as Puck—was found dead. Murdered. Oberon makes Pocket an offer he can’t refuse: he will make Pocket his fool and have his death sentence lifted if Pocket finds out who killed Robin Goodfellow. But as anyone who is even vaguely aware of the Bard’s most performed play ever will know, nearly every character has a motive for wanting the mischievous sprite dead.With too many suspects and too little time, Pocket must work his own kind of magic to find the truth, save his neck, and ensure that all ends well.A rollicking tale of love, magic, madness, and murder, Shakespeare for Squirrels is a Midsummer Night’s noir—a wicked and brilliantly funny good time conjured by the singular imagination of Christopher Moore.",Hardcover,Humor,90.4k follower,"1,170 reviews",94,108 (1%),400 (5%),"1,895 (23%)","3,256 (41%)","2,268 (28%)"

The core of it rings so true for me, but the application has been harder.""Brené replied, ""I'm so glad we're talking about this. It makes sense to me. Especially in terms of vulnerability.

"The Barbarous Years: The Peopling of British North America: The Conflict of Civilizations, 1600-1675",Bernard Bailyn,"1,035",ratings160,"November 6, 2012","From an acclaimed historian of early America, a compelling account of the first great transit of people from Britain, Europe, and Africa to the British colonies of North America and their involvements with each other and the indigenous peoples of the eastern seaboard.The immigrants were a mixed multitude—coming from England, the Netherlands, German and Italian states, France, Africa, Sweden and Finland. They moved to the western hemisphere for different reasons, from different social backgrounds and cultures. Even the majority that came from England fitted no distinct socioeconomic or cultural pattern. They came bearing their diverse life styles: from commercialized London and southeast; from isolated farmlands in the north; from Midlands towns south and west. They represented a spectrum of religious attachments. They came hoping to re-create these diverse lifestyles in a remote and, to them, barbarous environment. In the early years, their stories are mostly ones of confusion, failure, violence, and the loss of civility as they sought to normalize situations and recapture lost worlds. And in the process, they tore apart the normalities of the people whose world they had invaded.      Later generations often gentrified these early years of the peopling of British North America, but there was nothing genteel about it. Bernard Bailyn shows that it was a thoroughly brutal encounter—not only between the Europeans and native peoples and between Europeans and Africans, but among Europeans themselves, as they sought to control and prosper in the new configurations of life that were emerging around them. It is these vivid, compelling stories that Bailyn gives us in this extraordinary, fresh account of the early years of our nation.","614 pages, Hardcover",History,112 follower,160 reviews,122,10 (<1%),57 (5%),242 (23%),426 (41%),300 (28%)

In apartheid South Africa in 1976, medical student Isaac Muthethe is forced to flee his country after witnessing a friend murdered by white members of the South African Defense Force. He is smuggled into Botswana, where he is hired as a gardener by a young American woman, Alice Mendelssohn, who has abandoned her Ph.D. studies to follow her husband to Africa. When Isaac goes missing and Alice goes searching for him, what she finds will change her life and inextricably bind her to this sunburned, beautiful land.
