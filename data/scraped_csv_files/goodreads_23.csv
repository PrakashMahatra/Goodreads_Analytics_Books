It also includes the original set packaging. This novel is subtitled “A Romance,” but in the preface the author “I use the term [romance] playfully in one of its several older senses, particularly that of a story of action with a heroic protagonist and a strong love interest. . . . I might cite as a model for my own use of the word the haunting classic of a later period, R. D. Blackmore’s Lorna Doone, which is in fact subtitled A Romance of Exmoor. The present book, then, could be called A Romance of Hampshire.” ***** The book is set in Antigua and England, 1810–1814. The jacket copy “An epic, a romance, and a mystery, Edmund Persuader is the tale of a man both blessed and cursed by his powers of persuasion. Those powers seem to perform the greatest wonders when they work him ill, yet fail when he needs them most—until he can emerge from the depths of moral error and climb toward the exaltation of redeeming love.” ***** Highly recommended to those who love Jane Austen’s works, though it is not a clone or a sequel. Readers find it more readable than Austen but equally satisfying. ***** “I look forward to re-reading it many times and gaining more from it each time.

In this desolate dystopian future, the Greenleigh orphans are “privileged” with the task of building mechanical trees for Bygonne, so their world behind The Wall can breathe another day, and so the Superiors may continue their malevolent reign. Lured by a yearning for freedom, tenacious curiosity, and hunger for adventure, Joy discovers hope and magic amid the misery, and power in her promise to care for those remaining, whom she loves enough to risk her life for. To save them, herself, and the boy she adores from the abuse and slavery by the Superiors, Joy must entrust the aid of an unlikely ally who harbors a dangerous secret. With an intriguing stranger at the helm, Joy and the treemakers embark on an intense and terrifying, yet liberating quest for the truth about the existence of the forbidden paradise beyond The Wall.   *Please note: This is the first book in the series.

Outcry: Holocaust memoirs,Manny Steinberg,"3,606",ratings341,"First published January 1, 2007","Outcry - Holocaust Memoirs, a profoundly moving autobiographyManny Steinberg spent his teens in Nazi extermination camps in Germany and Poland, miraculously surviving while millions perished. This is his story. Born in 1925 in the Jewish ghetto in Radom (Poland), Manny soon realized that people of Jewish faith were increasingly being regarded as outsiders. When the Nazis invaded in September 1939 the nightmare started. The city’s Jewish population had no chance of escaping and was faced with starvation, torture, sexual abuse and ultimately deportation. Outcry is the candid and moving account of a teenager who survived four Nazi camps: Dachau, Auschwitz, Vaihingen and Neckagerach. While being subjected to torture and degradation, he agonized over two haunting questions: ""Why the Jews?"" and ""How can the world let this happen?"" These questions remain hard to answer. Manny’s brother Stanley had jumped off the cattle wagon on the way to the extermination camp where his mother and younger brother were to perish. Desperately lonely and hungry, Stanley stood outside the compound hoping to catch a glimpse of Manny and their father. Once he discovered that they were among the prisoners, he turned himself in. The days were marked by hunger, cold, hard labor, and fear. Knowing that other members of the family were in the same camp kept them alive. Since acknowledging each other would have meant death, they pretended to be complete strangers. Manny relates how he was served human flesh and was forced to shave the heads of female corpses and pull out their teeth. Cherishing a picture of his beloved mother in his wooden shoe, he miraculously survived the terror of the Polish and German concentration camps together with his father and brother. When the Americans arrived in April 1945, Manny was little more than a living skeleton, with several broken ribs and suffering from a serious lung condition, wearing only a dirty, ragged blanket. This autobiography was written to fulfill a promise Manny made to himself during his first days of freedom. By publishing these Holocaust memoirs, the author wants to ensure that the world never forgets what happened during WWII. The narrative is personal, unencumbered and direct. Outcry touches the reader with its directness and simplicity. The story is told through the eyes of an old man forcing himself to relive years of intense suffering. It is an account of human cruelty, but also a testimony to the power of love and hope. Memoirs worthy of being adapted for the big screen. ""I read this book with a very heavy heart and tears running down my face. For Manny's endurance and his brother Stanley to be so tested is truly a testament to life!"" ""Very well written as it goes straight to the reader's heart!"" ""Manny Steinberg shares his extraordinary teenage story of surviving four concentration camps in an account noteworthy for its straightforward, unencumbered narrative. His is a story almost everyone can imagine happening to themselves - no less harrowing than more dramatic renditions of Holocaust survival, but somehow more compelling, and universal, for the unembellished simplicity of his style.""

It combines an engaging narrative, stories from people's lives, and research-informed exercises and worksheets designed to help you cultivate a rich sense of meaning and purpose. Written by Dr. Gleb Tsipursky, this workbook draws on the author's scholarship on meaning and purpose and his experience as a science popularizer and volunteer President of Intentional Insights. Tsipursky will donate most of the profit to Intentional Insights, a nonprofit devoted to empowering people to refine and reach their goals by providing research-based content to help improve thinking, feeling, and behavior patterns. ""With his warm, engaging, and vulnerable style, Dr. Tsipursky shares his own personal struggle, and that of many others, to reconcile the world of science and reason with the more elusive and subtle pingings of the human heart - to create a life that is larger than oneself,"" wrote Brandon Peele, purpose coach and Founder of PlanetPurpose and EVR1 Institute. ""Dr. Tsipursky shows how modern research in fields such as cognitive psychology and neuroscience provide demonstrable strategies that allow us to create a purpose - our own purpose,"" according to Dr. Bo Bennett, a Doctor of Psychology and author of Logically Fallacious. Those who read draft versions gained much from their experience. ""Its research-based strategies for evaluating one's purpose and meaning have helped me develop a clearer vision for my future. I am currently pursuing a new set of goals - both personally and professionally - that align with my values,"" in the words of John Johnson. Science really can answer life's big questions, such as ""why am I here,"" as shown by a wave of recent research in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and medicine. The research highlights that such questions are vital, since people who lack a rich sense of purpose have significantly worse mental and physical health. The vast majority of guidance on meaning and purpose comes from traditional sources such as cultural heritage and religion. While this guidance works for some, unfortunately traditional sources of meaning and purpose do not speak nearly so well to others who want an evidence-based approach in which they can be truly confident.

Perquè, fins ara, d’aquella guerra només he sentit les versions que vénen de dalt o de l’enemic.»VICTUS és una novel·la històrica que ens narra la guerra de Successió espanyola, un conflicte que pot considerar-se la primera de les conteses mundials i que s’acaba l’11 de setembre del 1714 amb l’apocalíptic assalt a Barcelona. També és la tragèdia d’en Martí Zuviría, un jove barceloní, alumne avantatjat del marquès de Vauban, que es converteix en un geni de l’enginyeria militar.VICTUS és un prodigi d’informació i rigor històric al servei d’un relat àgil, potent i directe, amb una dicció rabiosament contemporània, que ens porta de França a Barcelona passant per Madrid, Toledo, Tortosa o les batalles de Brihuega i Almansa. I és també una obra sobre la Barcelona irreductible del 1714, que va sofrir un setge desigual de tretze mesos i el bombardeig de més de trenta mil projectils.VICTUS posa en qüestió les versions oficials de tots dos bàndols i cedeix la paraula als autèntics protagonistes de la història, des de la figura immensa d’en Villarroel, el general que va defensar la capital catalana amb llàgrimes als ulls, fins als civils i soldats anònims de totes les nacions que van lluitar a un costat i l’altre de les muralles.Però, per sobre de tot, VICTUS és un festí literari de primer ordre que es devora de la forma en què sempre s’han devorat les grans obres, com ho demostra que se n’hagin venut els drets al rus, l’alemany, l’holandès, l’italià, el portuguès, el coreà, el croata i el francès.","608 pages, Hardcover",Historical Fiction,272 followers,218 reviews,31 books272 followers,35 (1%),103 (4%),459 (17%),"1,028 (40%)",930 (36%)

Rock the Boat: How to Use Conflict to Heal and Deepen Your Relationship,Resmaa Menakem,97,ratings14,"First published April 28, 2015","An honest look at what really works to bring more intimacy and deeper trust into your relationship. Couples therapist Resmaa Manakem challenges couples not to avoid conflict—Don’t be afraid to rock the boat! The emotional transformation that results can forge a greater, more mature intimacy; a deeper trust; and a stronger bond.Conflict is a natural part of any intimate relationship. Yet most couples either avoid it or try to smooth over their differences. This results in at least one partner compromising their integrity—and stunting their own growth. Gritty, often irreverent, and always practical, Rock the Boat challenges couples not to flee from conflicts, because the emotional stalemate that conflicts produce creates an opportunity for profound transformation. This transformation affirms each partner’s individuality while forging a more mature intimacy, a greater trust, and a deeper bond.Rock the Boat challenges the idea that conflict between partners is unhealthy or something to avoid. Instead, it encourages both people to stand by what they need and who they are—but to do so with compassion rather than competitiveness or vengefulness. This is the purpose of an intimate to create an atmosphere where both people learn to grow up and mature in their relationship by appreciating each other’s individual needs in a caring and mature way.Author Resmaa Menakem, a licensed clinical social worker specializing in couples therapy, addresses key factors in making this happen, including accepting discomfort and uncertainty; honesty and openness about sex, money, kids, and in-laws; recognizing when conflict might escalate into violence or abuse; and, when appropriate, finding and working with a good therapist.Rock the Boat is not about ideals, or what we hope or imagine relationships to be. It's an honest, unflinching look at what actually works.","240 pages, Paperback",Relationships,486 followers,14 reviews,12 books486 followers,2 (2%),1 (1%),10 (10%),32 (32%),52 (53%)
