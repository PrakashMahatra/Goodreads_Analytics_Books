Petty: The Biography,Warren Zanes,"4,975",ratings615,"First published October 20, 2015","An exhilarating and intimate account of the life of music legend Tom Petty, by an accomplished writer and musician who toured with PettyNo one other than Warren Zanes, rocker and writer and friend, could author a book about Tom Petty that is as honest and evocative of Petty's music and the remarkable rock and roll history he and his band helped to write.Born in Gainesville, Florida, with more than a little hillbilly in his blood, Tom Petty was a Southern shit kicker, a kid without a whole lot of promise. Rock and roll made it otherwise. From meeting Elvis, to seeing the Beatles on Ed Sullivan, to producing Del Shannon, backing Bob Dylan, putting together a band with George Harrison, Dylan, Roy Orbison, and Jeff Lynne, making records with Johnny Cash, and sending well more than a dozen of his own celebrated recordings high onto the charts, Tom Petty's story has all the drama of a rock and roll epic. Now in his mid-sixties, still making records and still touring, Petty, known for his reclusive style, has shared with Warren Zanes his insights and arguments, his regrets and lasting ambitions, and the details of his life on and off the stage.This is a book for those who know and love the songs, from ""American Girl"" and ""Refugee"" to ""Free Fallin'"" and ""Mary Jane's Last Dance,"" and for those who want to see the classic rock and roll era embodied in one man's remarkable story. Dark and mysterious, Petty manages to come back, again and again, showing us what the music can do and where it can take us.","323 pages, Hardcover",Music,111 followers,615 reviews,14 books111 followers,35 (<1%),113 (2%),650 (13%),"1,910 (38%)","2,267 (45%)"

The wounded Iraqi war vet and ex-cop must rely on his wits, his fists, and a wry sense of gallows humor to make it through each challenging day. For at his core, this transplanted West Virginian is a throwback to an antebellum time: he is a southern man of honor.  But his latest mission may be his last.  The task seems straightforward—find industrialist Jacob Cahill’s missing teenage daughter Sarah and bring her safely home. But for John Brenner, nothing ever goes quite as planned. In searching for the girl he will discover a new and unimaginable corruption hiding beneath a corporate façade … and come face to face with a ruthless killer known to his victims only by a macabre appellation: Boneless Chuck.  What begins as a simple disappearance morphs into something far more insidious as John finds himself plunged into a horrifying world of organ harvesting, torture, mutilation, and madness. Every dark trick John learned in his former trade of dealing death to the deserving will be brought to bear as he tries to keep his promise of bringing the girl back alive. In doing so, not only will his skills be tested to the breaking point, but his very sanity as he battles a grasping evil that stretches across the globe.  But darkness has met its match. Because sometimes it takes a man who’s spent quality time in the realms of the damned … to send someone else there. So strap down and hang on.  John Brenner has just been dropped into hell.  From the book: “Son.” My voice degenerated to a guttural rasp. “Don’t make me kill you.” I was thinking of Sarah. She really didn’t need to have this added to her experience. I was asking for her sake. “Please.”  “Don’t beg, briar.” His reply didn’t even sound human. “It turns my gut. What’s about to happen, you can’t stop it. Nobody’s that good.”  I held my mark.  Still smiling, his knuckle grew white as it tightened down on the Glock’s trigger, taking up the last half-ounce of slack as his eyes flickered his intent. Sarah moaned in fear.  And then everything stopped as my Browning roared, its round rocketing six feet across the room and straight into his open blue eye.  The bullet mushroomed as it hit, growing instantly from the size of a pea to the diameter of a gumdrop. That’s what hollow points do. As the round exited his head at that short distance the entire back of his skull vanished in a spray of pink and gray, his gun flying free and unfired from his limp hand as he slumped to the floor, deader than four o’clock.  “I am, Albert,” I whispered to his still form. “I’m that good.”  And then Sarah started screaming again.","332 pages, Kindle Edition",Thriller,9 followers,17 reviews,4 books9 followers,2 (2%),2 (2%),10 (13%),28 (38%),30 (41%)

De tragikomische maalstroom van gebeurtenissen geeft het ingeslapen dorp een onverwachte dynamiek waar het niet meer van zal herstellen.Tommy Wieringa schreef met Joe Speedboot een gedreven, aanstekelijke ontwikkelingsroman, met een hoofdrol voor de mateloze verbeeldingskracht van één man.Fransje Hermans, de verteller van het verhaal, is na een ongeluk invalide geraakt en heeft voorgoed zijn spraakvermogen verloren.

The World Without Us,Alan Weisman,"41,649","ratings3,882","First published July 10, 2007","A penetrating, page-turning tour of a post-human EarthIn The World Without Us, Alan Weisman offers an utterly original approach to questions of humanity's impact on the planet: he asks us to envision our Earth, without us. In this far-reaching narrative, Weisman explains how our massive infrastructure would collapse and finally vanish without human presence; which everyday items may become immortalized as fossils; how copper pipes and wiring would be crushed into mere seams of reddish rock; why some of our earliest buildings might be the last architecture left; and how plastic, bronze sculpture, radio waves, and some man-made molecules may be our most lasting gifts to the universe.The World Without Us reveals how, just days after humans disappear, floods in New York's subways would start eroding the city's foundations, and how, as the world's cities crumble, asphalt jungles would give way to real ones. It describes the distinct ways that organic and chemically treated farms would revert to wild, how billions more birds would flourish, and how cockroaches in unheated cities would perish without us. Drawing on the expertise of engineers, atmospheric scientists, art conservators, zoologists, oil refiners, marine biologists, astrophysicists, religious leaders from rabbis to the Dalai Lama, and paleontologists—who describe a prehuman world inhabited by megafauna like giant sloths that stood taller than mammoths—Weisman illustrates what the planet might be like today, if not for us.From places already devoid of humans (a last fragment of primeval European forest; the Korean DMZ; Chernobyl), Weisman reveals Earth's tremendous capacity for self-healing. As he shows which human devastations are indelible, and which examples of our highest art and culture would endure longest, Weisman's narrative ultimately drives toward a radical but persuasive solution that needn't depend on our demise. It is narrative nonfiction at its finest, and in posing an irresistible concept with both gravity and a highly readable touch, it looks deeply at our effects on the planet in a way that no other book has.","324 pages, Hardcover",Nonfiction,542 followers,"3,882 reviews",13 books542 followers,"1,085 (2%)","2,821 (6%)","10,384 (24%)","16,068 (38%)","11,291 (27%)"

Beneath an African Sky,Catherine Keese,4,ratings2,"First published February 1, 2015","When Catherine Keese first set out to write this book, she was full of trepidation. “How,” she asked, “would I ever be able to remember all the happenings of our lives back then, and more importantly the nuance of it all? Could I accurately portray the magnificent, equatorial landscape we called home, or the vastness of the African sky? Could I relate what life was like under the forbearance of Africa’s natural order where man, beast, and the elements lent constant danger and exhilaration to every hour of every day? Would I be able to adequately explain the fragility of our political posture and prospects? And could I do justice to the colorful characters who shared with us the anxieties and rewards of life in a British colony? I think I was horrified that I might end up with a book that defined mundaneness—like Lionel Hardcastle’s proverbial My Life in Kenya in the TV series ‘As Time Goes By’.”In this fascinating book, told with great candor and humor, she adds: “. . . for better or worse, I offer the story of our family in Kenya, and the fascinating, pivotal times in which we lived. While told from my personal perspective, it is the record of a Scottish family’s evolution from its working-class roots in Glasgow, through emigration, war, jubilation, illness, defiance, loss, and redemption. It is also the tale of life on a Kenya farm with all its trials and tribulations. Yet what remains for me is a picture of sun-drenched exuberance under that vast African sky—a Van Gogh painting whose bold, profuse brushstrokes and vibrant colors are the distillation of times gone by and all that happened to us.

"VietnamEazy: A Novel About Mothers, Daughters and Food",Trami Nguyen Cron,65,ratings15,"First published July 6, 2016","Like Viet Thanh Nguyen’s acclaimed The Sympathizer, VietnamEazy captures with startling honesty and detail the dizzying dislocation that so many Vietnamese arrivals in the United States have experienced and, like Amy Tan’s The Joy Luck Club, explores the age-old mysteries of the mother-daughter relationship. It tells the story of Kieu, a Vietnamese-American woman, and her quest for success on a TV cooking show, introducing the intoxicating allure of Vietnamese food to a general audience, interwoven with the haunting, sorrowful tale of her family and upbringing. This is a universal tale of redemption that mothers and daughters can read together and discuss, preferably over a steaming bowl of pho.Kieu is an every-woman trying to navigate challenges that plague so many of us — a difficult mother who shows her love in all the wrong ways, a mix of insecurity and uneasy pride when it comes to her passion in life, bringing traditional Vietnamese cooking to the U.S. with the twist of doing so with simple recipes featuring ingredients easy to find. When to her astonishment she is chosen to compete in the reality-TV cooking program 'Sliced and Diced,' famously cutthroat and competitive, she embarks on a journey of personal discovery that will take her in surprising new directions - leaving her in the end with no easy answers, but a deeper sense of connection to her mother and grandmother and to the land of her birth. Along the way Cron, a gifted cook, brings alive the delectable flavors and textures of Vietnamese food. Each of the eight chapters starts with a recipe, which the story of the chapter then evokes in vivid, unforgettable detail, and together the eight recipes of the book add up to an entire feast - literally, an epic meal much like that served to Vietnamese Emperors, and also figuratively, a feast of story-telling.","192 pages, Paperback",Fiction,118 followers,15 reviews,2 books118 followers,2 (3%),6 (9%),21 (32%),17 (26%),19 (29%)

Fra i due ha ben presto inizio un rapporto anche eroticamente molto intenso. Kemal tuttavia non si decide a lasciare Sibel, la fidanzata: per quanto di mentalità aperta e moderna, in lui sono comunque radicati i valori tradizionali (e anche un certo opportunismo). Così si fidanza e perde tutto: sconvolta dal suo comportamento, Füsun scompare, mentre Kemal, preda di una passione che non gli dà tregua, trascura gli affari e alla fine scioglie il fidanzamento. Quando, dopo atroci patimenti, i due amanti si ritrovano, nella vita di Füsun tutto è cambiato. Kemal però non si dà per vinto.

Bee Time: Lessons from the Hive,Mark L. Winston,396,ratings49,"First published January 1, 2014","Being among bees is a full-body experience, Mark Winston writes from the low hum of tens of thousands of insects and the pungent smell of honey and beeswax, to the sight of workers flying back and forth between flowers and the hive. The experience of an apiary slows our sense of time, heightens our awareness, and inspires awe. Bee Time"" presents Winston s reflections on three decades spent studying these creatures, and on the lessons they can teach about how humans might better interact with one another and the natural world.Like us, honeybees represent a pinnacle of animal sociality. How they submerge individual needs into the colony collective provides a lens through which to ponder human societies. Winston explains how bees process information, structure work, and communicate, and examines how corporate boardrooms are using bee societies as a model to improve collaboration. He investigates how bees have altered our understanding of agricultural ecosystems and how urban planners are looking to bees in designing more nature-friendly cities.The relationship between bees and people has not always been benign. Bee populations are diminishing due to human impact, and we cannot afford to ignore what the demise of bees tells us about our own tenuous affiliation with nature. Toxic interactions between pesticides and bee diseases have been particularly harmful, foreshadowing similar effects of pesticides on human health. There is much to learn from bees in how they respond to these challenges. In sustaining their societies, bees teach us ways to sustain our own.""","296 pages, Hardcover",Nonfiction,6 followers,49 reviews,10 books6 followers,3 (<1%),28 (7%),87 (21%),167 (42%),111 (28%)

Old fears old excitements, even memories of my old equipment, and with it all, vivid as the sound of gunfire, came the smell of battle in the air of the book. I loved reading The Hogs of Cold Harbor. I was in the Civil War on the Southern side. That is no small education for a Northerner like me.""-Norman MailerThe wild hogs of Virginia are vicious. They attack, kill and devour. They show no mercy and eat their victims alive. The wild hogs are smart. They strategize with their enemies. They are worthy adversaries. But the wild hogs have honor. They will not hurt or destroy their own.In the minds of some, this last, simple fact raises the wild hogs of Virginia to an ethical level far above that of Man. A hog will not kill its own. But Man will and has.The Civil War brought man against man, family against family, and brother against brother. Some fought for their God, others for freedom and liberty, still others to protect their homes and loved ones. Young men fought for the pride of their land and country and heritage.But in the battlefields, looking upon the mountains of dead and wounded, seeing the enemy’s face and recognizing it as your own, a man begins to question the true meaning of honor. As the wild pigs feast upon the slaughtered masses of men, yet show compassion and solitude with their own kind, field soldiers may begin to look deep into their souls at their own morality and purpose.John Henry Hess joined the confederate army with his heart filled with pride. He would fight for his country, for his wife and unborn child, and for the right of the Lord to rule over His great land. There was not a Rebel more proud than Johnny Hess was.But in those dark fields, young Johnny Hess came to realize that there were stunning similarities between Man and Animal. The body of a man, blown apart by gunfire, is almost identical to that of a hog. There was little difference between the yearly slaughter of the farm hogs and the slaughter of men on the battlefield. Except that a hog would not kill its own, as he had done.The Hogs of Cold Harbor implores readers to question our history as well as themselves. Author and historian Richard Lee Fulgham, M.A. crafted this haunting tale of the good and evil that dwells within us all based on the diaries of Southwest Virginian John Henry Hess, Pvt., CSA (Company G, 29th Virginia Infantry Regiment, Pickett’s Division, Longstreet’s Corps, 1862-1864). Is Man truly no better than the animals he commands and destroys? The Hogs of Cold Harbor is a powerful, haunting story in which Richard Lee Fulgham delves deep into the timeless questions of our existence. Are we Man? Are we Animal?

The young man from a shadowy government entity approaches Mel, a low-level faculty member, with an incredible offer. The only condition: she must sign a nondisclosure agreement in return for the rather large sum of money.Tristan needs Mel to translate some very old documents, which, if authentic, are earth-shattering. They prove that magic actually existed and was practiced for centuries. But the arrival of the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment weakened its power and endangered its practitioners. Magic stopped working altogether in 1851, at the time of the Great Exhibition at London’s Crystal Palace—the world’s fair celebrating the rise of industrial technology and commerce. Something about the modern world ""jams"" the ""frequencies"" used by magic, and it’s up to Tristan to find out why.And so the Department of Diachronic Operations—D.O.D.O. —gets cracking on its real mission: to develop a device that can bring magic back, and send Diachronic Operatives back in time to keep it alive . . . and meddle with a little history at the same time. But while Tristan and his expanding operation master the science and build the technology, they overlook the mercurial—and treacherous—nature of the human heart.Written with the genius, complexity, and innovation that characterize all of Neal Stephenson’s work and steeped with the down-to-earth warmth and humor of Nicole Galland’s storytelling style, this exciting and vividly realized work of science fiction will make you believe in the impossible, and take you to places—and times—beyond imagining.","752 pages, Hardcover",Science Fiction,26.2k followers,"3,901 reviews",149 books26.2k followers,592 (1%),"2,248 (7%)","7,137 (22%)","12,869 (40%)","8,879 (27%)"

Her farmhouse in northern Zimbabwe was being decimated at the hands of an angry mob of Robert Mugabe’s war veterans, who had been tasked with driving white farmers from their homes. In just a few short days, forty-five of Mandy’s neighbours narrowly escaped with their lives and decided to leave Zimbabwe behind.These families would forge a new life overseas, safe from the recriminations of Mugabe’s warmongers—yet, as they fled, they left so much behind, not least the beloved pets and farm animals to which they had devoted their lives. Mandy knew that her life, and that of her family, had changed forever. As her friend fled Zimbabwe, she had only one parting request. “We need your help,” she said. “It’s our horses. Something has got to be done about our horses.”It was in this moment that Mandy, along with her husband, Pat, made the decision not to shrink into fear but to reach out and help. Over the following months, they rescued a group of 104 horses from the violence of the home invasions and, in one case, quite literally from the jaws of lions. As they moved across the Zimbabwean countryside, seeking ever more remote enclaves of safety for a herd of horses, it became clear: it was not just the family who were rescuing the horses, but the horses who were rescuing the family.One Hundred and Four Horses is the story of an idyllic existence torn apart, and a story of incredible bonds—a love of the land, the strength of a family, and the connection between man and the most majestic of animals, the horse.","272 pages, ebook",Africa,6 followers,143 reviews,2 books6 followers,16 (1%),39 (3%),196 (19%),399 (38%),376 (36%)

A tragic childhood event left her in the company of a cast of patron saints who pop in and out of her life like unwelcome tourists. She tries to find solace in her hard work in London...but then she meets the inimitable Mr. Flood. A menace by all accounts, Cathal Flood is a widower living alone in a Gothic Dorset mansion crawling with collector’s items and feral cats.

But Maud is this insolent old man’s last chance: if she can help him get the house in order, he might be able to fend off the deportation. So the unlikely pair begin to cooperate, connecting over their shared love of folk tales and their suspicion of Gabriel, Cathal’s overbearing son.
