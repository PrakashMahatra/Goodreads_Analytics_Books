 is an exploration of a mystery: Why, in the last decade, has the diagnosis ""gender dysphoria,"" transformed from a vanishingly rare affliction, applying almost exclusively to boys and men, to an epidemic among teenage girls?  Author Abigail Shrier presents shocking statistics and stories from real families to show that America and the West have become fertile ground for a ""transgender craze"" that has nothing to do with real gender dysphoria and everything to do with our cultural frailty. Teenage girls are taking courses of testosterone and disfiguring their bodies. Parents are undermined; experts are over-relied upon; dissenters in science and medicine are intimidated; free speech truckles under renewed attack; socialized medicine bears hidden consequences; and an intersectional era has arisen in which the desire to escape a dominant identity encourages individuals to take cover in victim groups.

Standard Operating Procedure,Philip Gourevitch,536,ratings80,"April 1, 2008","An utterly original literary and intellectual collaboration by two of our keenest moral and political observers has produced a nonfiction Heart of Darkness for our time: the first full reckoning of what actually happened at Abu Ghraib prison, based on hundreds of hours of exclusive interviews with the Americans involved.The Ballad of Abu Ghraib reveals the stories of the American soldiers who took and appeared in the iconic photographs of the Iraq war-the haunting digital snapshots from Abu Ghraib prison that shocked the world-and simultaneously illuminates and alters forever our understanding of those images and the events they depict. Drawing on more than two hundred hours of Errol Morris's startlingly frank and intimate interviews with Americans who served at Abu Ghraib and with some of their Iraqi prisoners, as well as on his own research, Philip Gourevitch has written a relentlessly surprising account of Iraq's occupation from the inside out-rendering vivid portraits of guards and prisoners ensnared in an appalling breakdown of command authority and moral order.What did we think we saw in the infamous photographs, and what were we, in fact, looking at? What did the people in the photographs think they were doing, and why did they take them? What was ""standard operating procedure"" and what was ""being creative"" when it came to making prisoners uncomfortable? Who was giving orders, and who was following them? Where does the line lie between humiliation and torture, and why and how does that matter? Was the true Abu Ghraib ""scandal"" a result of an expose or a cover-up?In exploring these questions, Gourevitch and Morris have crafted a nonfiction morality play that stands to endure as essential reading long after the current war in Iraq passes from the headlines. By taking us deep into the voices and characters of the men and women who lived the horror of Abu Ghraib, the authors force us, whatever our politics, to reexamine the pat explanations in which we have been offered-or sought-refuge, and to see afresh this watershed episode. Instead of a ""few bad apples,"" we are confronted with disturbingly ordinary young American men and women who have been dropped into something out of Dante's Inferno.The Ballad of Abu Ghraib is a book that makes you think and makes you see-an essential contribution from two of our finest nonfiction artists working at the peak of their powers.","286 pages, Hardcover",,488 follower,80 reviews,58,11 (2%),24 (4%),115 (21%),234 (43%),152 (28%)
Devotion,Howard Norman,276,ratings45,"January 1, 2007","Fans of Howard Norman, the internationally acclaimed author of The Hunting of L and The Bird Artist and a two-time National Book Award finalist, will find in his latest novel -- an intense and intriguingly unconventional love story -- all the hallmarks of this masterly writer: sparkling yet spare language, a totally compelling air of mystery spread over our workaday world, and ability to capture the metaphorical heartbeat at the center of our lives.Like many of Howard Norman’s celebrated novels, Devotion begins with an announcement of a crime: on August 19, 1985, David Kozol and his father-in-law engaged in “assault by mutual affray.” Norman sets out to explore a great mystery: why seemingly quiet, contained people lose control. David and Maggie's story seemed straightforward enough; they met in a hotel lobby in London. For David, the simple fact was love at first sight. For Maggie, the attraction was similarly sudden and unprecedented in intensity. Their love affair, ""A fugue state of amorous devotion,"" turned into a whirlwind romance and marriage. So what could possibly enrage David enough that he would strike at the father of his new bride? Why would William, a gentle man who looks after an estate -- and its flock of swans -- in Nova Scotia, be so angry at the man who has just married his beloved only child, Maggie? And what would lead Maggie to believe that David has been unfaithful to her? In his signature style -- haunting and evocative -- Norman lays bare the inventive stupidities people are capable of when wounded and confused.At its core, Devotion is an elegantly constructed, never sentimental examination of love: romantic love (and its flip side, hate), filial love at its most tender, and, of course, love for the vast open spaces of Nova Scotia.","190 pages, Hardcover",,242 follower,45 reviews,51,12 (4%),32 (11%),105 (38%),89 (32%),38 (13%)

Born in a rural village in 1940, Wangari Maathai was already an iconoclast as a child, determined to get an education even though most girls were uneducated. We see her studying with Catholic missionaries, earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees in the United States, and becoming the first woman both to earn a PhD in East and Central Africa and to head a university department in Kenya. We witness her numerous run-ins with the brutal Moi government. She makes clear the political and personal reasons that compelled her, in 1977, to establish the Green Belt Movement, which spread from Kenya across Africa and which helps restore indigenous forests while assisting rural women by paying them to plant trees in their villages. We see how Maathai’s extraordinary courage and determination helped transform Kenya’s government into the democracy in which she now serves as assistant minister for the environment and as a member of Parliament. And we are with her as she accepts the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded in recognition of her “contribution to sustainable development, human rights, and peace.” In Unbowed, Wangari Maathai offers an inspiring message of hope and prosperity through self-sufficiency.","314 pages, Hardcover",,243 follower,756 reviews,39,153 (2%),319 (4%),"1,130 (17%)","2,365 (36%)","2,545 (39%)"
Searching for Shakespeare,Tarnya Cooper,19,ratings1,"April 28, 2006","In 1856 the newly founded National Portrait Gallery in London was presented with a compelling painting of Shakespeare known as the “Chandos” portrait. Yet, 150 years later, few scholars agree that a true contemporary portrait of the most famous playwright in the history of English literature actually exists. Using the questionable authenticity of this portrait as its starting point, this unique and fascinating book examines the connections between theatrical performance and Shakespeare’s references in the visual arts. Featuring numerous portraits and images of costumes, theater models, manuscripts, and maps, Searching for Shakespeare looks at the artist’s overall biography and life’s work. Portraits of Shakespeare’s contemporaries are also included––fellow actors, entertainers, and playwrights as well as his patrons. Insightful essays by distinguished scholars discuss a range of themes, from Shakespeare's sonnets, fame, and professional connections to his relationships with his actors, dramatists, and courtly and public audiences. They also reveal interesting background on the provenance and scholarship surrounding the “Chandos” portrait, which has been copied, purloined, and reproduced since it was first linked with Shakespeare at the beginning of the eighteenth century.For anyone interested in Shakespeare, the mystery surrounding his identity, and the performing and visual arts of the Elizabethan period, this is an essential book to own.","239 pages, Hardcover",,13 book,1 review,13,0 (0%),0 (0%),2 (10%),9 (47%),8 (42%)

Jesus Land: A Memoir,Julia Scheeres,"19,046","ratings1,743","September 6, 2005","For Julia Scheeres and her adopted brother David, ""Jesus Land"" stretched from their parents' fundamentalist home, past the hostilities of high school, and deep into a Christian reform school in the Dominican Republic. For these two teenagers - brother and sister, black and white - the 1980s were a trial by fire.In this memoir, Scheeres takes us from the familiar Midwest, a land of cottonwood trees and trailer parks, to a place beyond her imagining. At home, the Scheeres kids must endure the usual trials of adolescence - high-school hormones, incessant bullying, and the deep-seated restlessness of social misfits everywhere - under the shadow of virulent racism neither knows how to contend with. When they start to crack (or fight back), they are packed off to Escuela Caribe.

Leading from the Center: Why Moderates Make the Best Presidents,Gil Troy,10,ratings2,"June 9, 2008","George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy-most would agree their presidencies were among the most successful in American history. But what made these very different men such effective leaders? According to presidential historian Gil Troy, these presidents succeeded not because of their bold political visions, but because of their moderation. Although many of the presidential hopefuls for 2008 will claim to be moderates, the word cannot conceal a political climate defined by extreme rhetoric and virulent partisanship. In Leading From the Center , Gil Troy argues that this is a distinctly un -American state of affairs. The great presidents of American history have always sought a golden mean-from Washington, who brilliantly mediated between the competing visions of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, to Lincoln, who rescued the Union with his principled pragmatism, to the two Roosevelts, who united millions of Americans with their powerful, affirmative, nationalist visions. As America lines up to select a president for the future, Gil Troy astutely reminds us of the finest traditions of presidential leadership from our nation's past.","304 pages, Hardcover",,29 follower,2 reviews,39,1 (10%),1 (10%),2 (20%),5 (50%),1 (10%)

And, in 1969, history teaches, two Americans softly landed on the moon's Sea of Tranquility. But what if we faked the whole thing? What if the greatest scientific achievement of the 20th century was dramatized on sound stages safely on earth for a naively patriotic nation unaccustomed to special effects? It would be the greatest charade in history. One that would be kept so secret, knowledge of the truth could have deadly consequences.

Forces of Labor: Workers' Movements and Globalization Since 1870,Beverly J. Silver,107,ratings8,"April 1, 2003","Recasting labor studies in a long-term and global framework, the book draws on a major new database on world labor unrest to show how local labor movements have been related to world-scale political, economic, and social processes since the late nineteenth century. Through an in-depth empirical analysis of select global industries, the book demonstrates how the main locations of labor unrest have shifted from country to country together with shifts in the geographical location of production. It shows how the main sites of labor unrest have shifted over time together with the rise or decline of new leading sectors of capitalist development and demonstrates that labor movements have been deeply embedded (as both cause and effect) in world political dynamics. Over the history of the modern labor movement, the book isolates what is truly novel about the contemporary global crisis of labor movements. Arguing against the view that this is a terminal crisis, the book concludes by exploring the likely forms that emergent labor movements will take in the twenty-first century.","260 pages, Paperback",,5 follower,8 reviews,4,0 (0%),1 (<1%),10 (9%),43 (40%),53 (49%)

Touring the world’s stages as a circus act, they settled in the American South just prior to the Civil War. They eventually married two sisters from North Carolina, fathering twenty-one children between them, and lived for more than six decades never more than seven inches apart, attached at the chest by a small band of skin and cartilage.Woven from the fabric of fact, myth, and imagination, Strauss’s narrative gives poignant, articulate voice to these legendary brothers, and humanizes the freakish legend that grew up around them. Sweeping from the Far East and the court of the King of Siam to the shared intimacy of their lives in America, Chang and Eng rescues one of the nineteenth century’s most fabled human oddities from the sideshow of history, drawing from their extraordinary lives a novel of exceptional power and beauty.","336 pages, Paperback",,127 follower,263 reviews,30,75 (3%),302 (15%),807 (40%),585 (29%),236 (11%)
Yes Means Yes!: Visions of Female Sexual Power and a World Without Rape,Jaclyn Friedman,"5,176",ratings292,"December 2, 2008","In this groundbreaking new look at rape edited by writer and activist Jaclyn Freidman and Full Frontal Feminism and He's A Stud, She's A Slut author Jessica Valenti, the way we view rape in our culture is finally dismantled and replaced with a genuine understanding and respect for female sexual pleasure. Feminist, political, and activist writers alike will present their ideas for a paradigm shift from the ""No Means No"" model--an approach that while necessary for where we were in 1974, needs an overhaul today. Yes Means Yes will bring to the table a dazzling variety of perspectives and experiences focused on the theory that educating all people to value female sexuality and pleasure leads to viewing women differently, and ending rape. Yes Means Yes aims to have radical and far-reaching effects: from teaching men to treat women as collaborators and not conquests, encouraging men and women that women can enjoy sex instead of being shamed for it, and ultimately, that our children can inherit a world where rape is rare and swiftly punished. With commentary on public sex education, pornography, mass media, Yes Means Yes is a powerful and revolutionary anthology.","256 pages, ebook",,122 follower,292 reviews,7,90 (1%),190 (3%),744 (14%),"1,702 (32%)","2,450 (47%)"

The Patience Stone,Atiq Rahimi,"6,105","ratings1,027","January 1, 2008","“For far too long, Afghan women have been faceless and voiceless. Until now. With The Patience Stone, Atiq Rahimi gives face and voice to one unforgettable woman–and, one could argue, offers her as a proxy for the grievances of millions…it is a rich read, part allegory, part a tale of retribution, part an exploration of honor, love, sex, marriage, war. It is without doubt an important and courageous book.” from the introduction by Khaled Hosseini, author of The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid SunsIn Persian folklore, Syngue Sabour is the name of a magical black stone, a patience stone, which absorbs the plight of those who confide in it. It is believed that the day it explodes, after having received too much hardship and pain, will be the day of the Apocalypse. But here, the Syngue Sabour is not a stone but rather a man lying brain-dead with a bullet lodged in his neck. His wife is with him, sitting by his side. But she resents him for having sacrificed her to the war, for never being able to resist the call to arms, for wanting to be a hero, and in the end, after all was said and done, for being incapacitated in a small skirmish. Yet she cares, and she speaks to him. She even talks to him more and more, opening up her deepest desires, pains, and secrets. While in the streets rival factions clash and soldiers are looting and killing around her, she speaks of her life, never knowing if her husband really hears. And it is an extraordinary confession, without restraint, about sex and love and her anger against a man who never understood her, who mistreated her, who never showed her any respect or kindness. Her admission releases the weight of oppression of marital, social, and religious norms, and she leads her story up to the great secret that is unthinkable in a country such as Afghanistan. Winner of the Prix Goncourt, The Patience Stone captures with great courage and spare, poetic, prose the reality of everyday life for an intelligent woman under the oppressive weight of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.","141 pages, Hardcover",,327 follower,"1,027 reviews",27,194 (3%),546 (8%),"1,607 (26%)","2,382 (39%)","1,376 (22%)"

Eight years later, a schoolteacher who lived four miles away gave birth to a boy whose cherubic smile belied the fast growing tumors that soon riddled his face and chest. The doctors predicted he would not reach his first birthday. They were wrong, but that was only one of many surprises that would eventually come to light in Toms River, culminating in 2001 with a record legal settlement believed to top $35 million and an unprecedented government study confirming the existence of a long-suspected cluster of childhood cancer linked to polluted water and air. A detective story rooted in a scientific quest thousands of years old, Toms River is a tale of dumpers at midnight and deceptions in broad daylight, of corporate avarice and government neglect, and of a few brave individuals who would not keep silent.","560 pages, Hardcover",,63 follower,583 reviews,2,36 (<1%),136 (3%),822 (18%),"1,789 (41%)","1,564 (35%)"

Read a good review. Cover caught my eye. I can appreciate a cool cover. But it’s like the extra credit part of a test—it only enhances an already solid grade. Getting it right won’t help if most everything else is wrong. And getting it wrong won’t hurt if most everything else is right. (There are countless books I cherish whose covers I don’t like too much, or cannot even now recall.) The interior of the book—the terrain of its pages, where all those words took me, the tiny but very real spot it ultimately occupies in my mind—that becomes the book. Next I go to the flaps. The front flap needs to intrigue/not bore me, and the bio needs to tell me just enough about the author. I’ll do my best to extract the author’s entire existence from their 2-X-2 inch photo.Off to the back cover. I’ll be momentarily impressed when I see a blurb by a hot writer like ____, but I know that it is just as likely that I’ll like the book as hate it regardless of these quotes. I look at them in a more voyeuristic way, like a literary gaper’s delay: Wow, the author knows So and So. Bet they send each other clever text messages. Really the only thing I can gauge from the blurbs is my own pathetic jealousy level.To get a true sense of the book, I have to spend a minute inside. I’ll glance at the first couple pages, then flip to the middle, see if the language matches me somehow. It’s like dating, only with sentences. Some sentences, no matter how well-dressed or nice, just don’t do it for me. Others I click with instantly. It could be something as simple yet weirdly potent as a single word choice (tangerine). We’re meant to be, that sentence and me. And when it happens, you just know.","240 pages, Paperback",,"1,027 follower","1,208 reviews",81,130 (1%),397 (5%),"1,469 (21%)","2,530 (37%)","2,282 (33%)"

Between Heidi and Horror: A Brief Memoir of the Somme,Stewart Hennessey,12,ratings2,"December 21, 2011","Between Heidi and Horror is the autobiographical tale of Brinsley Fox's mysterious desertion from the Battle of the Somme. With admirable candour, Fox writes about precisely how the infamous Battle began, how he tried to prevent it and how he subsequently deserted to escape it.Known in his day as a spy, forger, thief, inveterate gambler and venal libertine, Fox's motives for being at the Battle were always suspect. He signed up to the British Army in 1914 largely because he was being pursued by violent moneylenders and the Criminal Investigation Department. Paradoxically, he was a reputed hero at the Somme. However, in these pages he reveals that to be broadly unjustified. Told with vicious humour, dark fatalism, astute observations and scant regard for moral fibre, Between Heidi and Horror is a compellingly honest and racy tale - albeit from the pen of an unsteady and shameless quitter.","68 pages, Kindle Edition",,4 follower,2 reviews,7,1 (8%),1 (8%),2 (16%),4 (33%),4 (33%)
