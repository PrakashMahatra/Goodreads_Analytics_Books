Looking for Peyton Place,Barbara Delinsky,"3,567",ratings200,"July 12, 2005","For Annie Barnes, going home to Middle River means dealing with truths long hidden, some of which she buried there herself. But it is a journey she knows she must take if she is to put to rest, once and for all, her misgivings about her mother's recent death.  To an outsider, Middle River is a picture-perfect New Hampshire town. But Annie grew up there, and she knows all its secrets -- as did her idol Grace Metalious, author of the infamous novel Peyton Place, which laid a small town's sexual secrets bare for all the world to see. Though Grace actually lived in a nearby town, the residents of Middle River have always believed she used them as the model for her revolutionary novel, and some even insist Annie's grandmother was the model for one of Grace's most scandalous characters. With these rumors and whispers about Peyton Place haunting her childhood, Annie came to identify so closely with the author that it was Grace and her bold rebellion against 1950s conformity that inspired Annie to get out of Middle River and make a life for herself in Washington, D.C.  It's been a good life, too. Annie Barnes is now a bestselling author, reaching that level with only her third novel. Success has given her a confidence she never had as a young girl in Middle River -- and it has given the residents of that town something new to worry about. When they hear Annie is returning for a lengthy visit, everyone, including Annie's two sisters, believes she's coming home to write about them.  Though amused by the discomfort she causes in Middle River, Annie has no intention of writing a novel about the town or its people. It is her mother's death -- under circumstances that don't quite add up -- that has brought her back, and soon her probing questions start to make people nervous. When she discovers evidence of dangerous pollutants emanating from the local paper mill -- poisons that she comes to believe contributed to her mother's fatal illness -- Annie finds herself at odds with most of the town's inhabitants, including her sisters, both of whom are seemingly unfazed by the incriminating evidence she uncovers. Because the mill is the town's main employer, everyone is afraid of what might happen if Annie digs deeper, and their fears soon start to turn ugly.  For Annie, though, there is no turning back, as passion and rage propel her forward in a determined quest. Coming face-to-face with decades of secrets and lies, she knows she must find the strength to move beyond the legacy of Grace Metalious, defying her past to heal the wounds of the town and her own family.","560 pages, Mass Market Paperback",Fiction,"4,168 follower",200 reviews,358,57 (1%),221 (6%),996 (27%),"1,214 (34%)","1,079 (30%)"

Full Body Burden: Growing Up in the Nuclear Shadow of Rocky Flats,Kristen Iversen,"4,128",ratings741,"January 1, 2012","Full Body Burden is a haunting work of narrative nonfiction about a young woman, Kristen Iversen, growing up in a small Colorado town close to Rocky Flats, a secret nuclear weapons plant once designated ""the most contaminated site in America."" It's the story of a childhood and adolescence in the shadow of the Cold War, in a landscape at once startlingly beautiful and—unknown to those who lived there—tainted with invisible yet deadly particles of plutonium.It's also a book about the destructive power of secrets—both family and government. Her father's hidden liquor bottles, the strange cancers in children in the neighborhood, the truth about what was made at Rocky Flats (cleaning supplies, her mother guessed)—best not to inquire too deeply into any of it.But as Iversen grew older, she began to ask questions. She learned about the infamous 1969 Mother's Day fire, in which a few scraps of plutonium spontaneously ignited and—despite the desperate efforts of firefighters—came perilously close to a ""criticality,"" the deadly blue flash that signals a nuclear chain reaction. Intense heat and radiation almost melted the roof, which nearly resulted in an explosion that would have had devastating consequences for the entire Denver metro area. Yet the only mention of the fire was on page 28 of the Rocky Mountain News, underneath a photo of the Pet of the Week. In her early thirties, Iversen even worked at Rocky Flats for a time, typing up memos in which accidents were always called ""incidents.""And as this memoir unfolds, it reveals itself as a brilliant work of investigative journalism—a detailed and shocking account of the government's sustained attempt to conceal the effects of the toxic and radioactive waste released by Rocky Flats, and of local residents' vain attempts to seek justice in court. Here, too, are vivid portraits of former Rocky Flats workers—from the healthy, who regard their work at the plant with pride and patriotism, to the ill or dying, who battle for compensation for cancers they got on the job.Based on extensive interviews, FBI and EPA documents, and class-action testimony, this taut, beautifully written book promises to have a very long half-life.","416 pages, Hardcover",Nonfiction,77 follower,741 reviews,8,41 (<1%),161 (3%),782 (18%),"1,711 (41%)","1,433 (34%)"

Two Views on Women in Ministry,James R. Beck,583,ratings72,"June 1, 2001","What does the Bible say about women’s roles in the church? With pros and cons on either side of a heated, ongoing debate, no definitive conclusions have emerged. This book furnishes you with a clear and thorough presentation of the two primary views on women in ministry so you can better understand each one’s strengths, weaknesses, and complexities.  Each view—egalitarian (equal ministry opportunity for both genders) and complementarian (ministry roles differentiated by gender)—is represented by two contributors. This revised edition of the book brings the exchange of ideas and perspectives into the traditional Counterpoints format. Each author states his or her case and is then critiqued by the other contributors.  The fair-minded, interactive Counterpoints forum allows you to compare and contrast the two different positions, and to form your own opinion concerning the practical and often deeply personal issue of women in ministry.  The Counterpoints series provides a forum for comparison and critique of different views on issues important to Christians. Counterpoints books address two categories: Church Life and Bible and Theology.

Black Cloud Rising,David Wright Faladé,"1,053",ratings194,"February 8, 2022","Already excerpted in the New Yorker , Black Cloud Rising is a compelling and important historical novel that takes us back to an extraordinary moment when enslaved men and women were shedding their bonds and embracing freedom By fall of 1863, Union forces had taken control of Tidewater Virginia, and established a toehold in eastern North Carolina, including along the Outer Banks. Thousands of freed slaves and runaways flooded the Union lines, but Confederate irregulars still roamed the region. In December, the newly formed African Brigade, a unit of these former slaves led by General Edward Augustus Wild—a one-armed, impassioned Abolitionist—set out from Portsmouth to hunt down the rebel guerillas and extinguish the threat.From this little-known historical episode comes Black Cloud Rising , a dramatic, moving account of these soldiers—men who only weeks earlier had been enslaved, but were now Union infantrymen setting out to fight their former owners. At the heart of the narrative is Sergeant Richard Etheridge, the son of a slave and her master, raised with some privileges but constantly reminded of his place. Deeply conflicted about his past, Richard is eager to show himself to be a credit to his race. As the African Brigade conducts raids through the areas occupied by the Confederate Partisan Rangers, he and his comrades recognize that they are fighting for more than territory. Wild’s mission is to prove that his troops can be trusted as soldiers in combat. And because many of the men have fled from the very plantations in their path, each raid is also an opportunity to free loved ones left behind. For Richard, this means the possibility of reuniting with Fanny, the woman he hopes to marry one day.With powerful depictions of the bonds formed between fighting men and heartrending scenes of sacrifice and courage, Black Cloud Rising offers a compelling and nuanced portrait of enslaved men and women crossing the threshold to freedom.","293 pages, Kindle Edition",Historical Fiction,1 book59 follower,194 reviews,1,10 (<1%),73 (6%),294 (27%),435 (41%),241 (22%)

But then her girlfriend, Amy, detransitioned and became Ames, and everything fell apart. Now Reese is caught in a self-destructive pattern: avoiding her loneliness by sleeping with married men. Ames isn't happy either. He thought detransitioning to live as a man would make life easier, but that decision cost him his relationship with Reese--and losing her meant losing his only family. Even though their romance is over, he longs to find a way back to her. When Ames's boss and lover, Katrina, reveals that she's pregnant with his baby--and that she's not sure whether she wants to keep it--Ames wonders if this is the chance he's been waiting for. Could the three of them form some kind of unconventional family--and raise the baby together? This provocative debut is about what happens at the emotional, messy, vulnerable corners of womanhood that platitudes and good intentions can't reach. Torrey Peters brilliantly and fearlessly navigates the most dangerous taboos around gender, sex, and relationships, gifting us a thrillingly original, witty, and deeply moving novel.","352 pages, Kindle Edition",Fiction,"1,333 follower","9,421 reviews",9,985 (1%),"3,685 (4%)","15,738 (20%)","33,484 (43%)","22,341 (29%)"

Did Ye Hear Mammy Died?,Séamas O'Reilly,"6,423",ratings772,"July 22, 2021","A heart-warming and hilarious family memoir of growing up as one of eleven children raised by a single dad in Northern Ireland at the end of the TroublesAfter the untimely death of his mother, five-year-old Séamas O'Reilly and his ten siblings were left to the care of their loving but understandably beleaguered father. In this thoroughly delightful memoir, we follow O'Reilly and the rest of his rowdy clan as they learn to cook, clean, do the laundry, and struggle (often hilariously) to keep the household running smoothly and turn into adults in the absence of the woman who had held them together. Along the way, we see O'Reilly through various adventures: There's the time the family's windows were blown out by an IRA bomb; the time a priest blessed their thirteen-seater caravan before they took off for a holiday on which they narrowly escaped death; the time O'Reilly worked as a guide in a leprechaun museum during the recession; and of course, the time he inadvertently found himself on ketamine while serving drinks to the president of Ireland. Through it all, the lovable, ginger-haired O'Reilly regales us with his combination of wit, absurdity, and tenderness, creating a charming and unforgettable portrait of an oddly gigantic family's search for some semblance of normalcy.","214 pages, Kindle Edition",Memoir,1 book106 follower,772 reviews,1,43 (<1%),206 (3%),"1,107 (17%)","2,563 (39%)","2,504 (38%)"
The Amphora Project,William Kotzwinkle,112,ratings16,"January 1, 2005","An enemy has come out of its deep dimensional cave. Infinitely older than humanity, it has crossed the barriers of our universe, and moves invisibly among us. It cares for nothing we might offer. It is beyond our science and religion. It has never enjoyed a sunrise, never tasted love. Because it isn't born of matter as we know it, it's a predator beyond our grasp.Our hope? Jockey Oldcastle, a fat, corrupt old star fighter with a chest full of medals purchased at an interplanetary pawnshop. But his navigator is Lizardo, from a race of highly intelligent reptiles, so hope is not entirely lost. Also in their ship is a shy, peace-loving entomologist who converses with butterflies and builds mechanical bees. This unlikely trio will grapple with the cosmic predator, assisted by a beautiful alien girl with vestigial wings and a birdlike voice that causes hallucinations. She's adored by a little robot named Upquark, who doubles as a suitcase and longs to experience romance.Along the way, they will explore the wonders of the Junk Moon, where old robots go to die, but not quietly. A gigantic rolling wheel of defective robots careens around the Junk Moon, crushing everything in its path. But the Junk Moon holds a secret at its core, and the old star fighter and his crew are there to crack it. Pursuing them is the Intelligence Agency, who are convinced they're guilty of crimes against society. Heading the Agency is a Vapor - a woman without a past, operating clandestinely, ruthlessly, and determined to brain-clean the old star fighter, turning him into a mindless shuffling cretin.Escape is required, to Alien City, marketplace of the planetary systems. Here traders from everywhere arrive, a writhing inhuman sea of creatures astonishing in their makeup and bizarre in their outlook. From their midst comes the Gamester, master of every known game in the universe and a formidable addition to the old star fighter's party. But whole cities are crystallizing, their inhabitants frozen in the streets, in their offices, and in restaurants. For this is how the extradimensional enemy kills, turning the human race into silent, staring statues highly polished and very dead.The Amphora Project is a ride through the future of the universe, featuring a fantastical cast of alien beings, quasi-human robots, intergalactic mercenaries, and two-thousand-year-old philosophers who have discovered the secret of eternal life. The Amphora Project combines elements of science fiction and fantasy and transcends the boundaries of both.","335 pages, Hardcover",Science Fiction,238 follower,16 reviews,93,11 (9%),25 (22%),40 (35%),25 (22%),11 (9%)
"Moon Witch, Spider King",Marlon James,"4,172",ratings639,"February 15, 2022","From Marlon James, author of the bestselling National Book Award finalist Black Leopard, Red Wolf, the second book in the Dark Star trilogy, his African Game of Thrones.In Black Leopard, Red Wolf, Sogolon the Moon Witch proved a worthy adversary to Tracker as they clashed across a mythical African landscape in search of a mysterious boy who disappeared. In Moon Witch, Spider King, Sogolon takes center stage and gives her own account of what happened to the boy, and how she plotted and fought, triumphed and failed as she looked for him. It’s also the story of a century-long feud—seen through the eyes of a 177-year-old witch—that Sogolon had with the Aesi, chancellor to the king. It is said that Aesi works so closely with the king that together they are like the eight limbs of one spider. Aesi’s power is considerable—and deadly. It takes brains and courage to challenge him, which Sogolon does for reasons of her own.Both a brilliant narrative device—seeing the story told in Black Leopard, Red Wolf from the perspective of an adversary and a woman—as well as a fascinating battle between different versions of empire, Moon Witch, Spider King delves into Sogolon’s world as she fights to tell her own story. Part adventure tale, part chronicle of an indomitable woman who bows to no man, it is a fascinating novel that explores power, personality, and the places where they overlap.","656 pages, Kindle Edition",Fantasy,"4,619 follower",639 reviews,34,51 (1%),144 (3%),623 (14%),"1,569 (37%)","1,785 (42%)"
